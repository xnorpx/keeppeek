# AI Guidelines

## Design with AI use in mind (M-DESIGN-FOR-AI) { #M-DESIGN-FOR-AI }

<why>maximum utility from agents working in your codebase.</why>

As a general rule, making APIs easier to use for humans also makes them easier to use by AI.
If you follow the guidelines in this book, you should be in good shape.

Rust's strong type system is a boon for agents, as their lack of genuine understanding can often be
counterbalanced by comprehensive compiler checks, which Rust provides in abundance.

With that said, there are a few guidelines which are particularly important to help make AI coding in Rust more effective:

- **Create Idiomatic Rust API Patterns**. The more your APIs, whether public or internal, look and feel like the majority of
  Rust code in the world, the better it is for AI. Follow the [Rust API Guidelines](https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/checklist.html)
  along with the guidelines from [Library / UX](../libs/ux).

- **Provide Thorough Docs**. Agents love good detailed docs. Include docs for all of your modules and public items in your crate.
  Assume the reader has a solid, but not expert, level of understanding of Rust, and that the reader understands the standard library.
  Follow
  [C-CRATE-DOC](https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/checklist.html#c-crate-doc),
  [C-FAILURE](https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/checklist.html#c-failure),
  [C-LINK](https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/checklist.html#c-link), and
  [M-MODULE-DOCS](../docs/#M-MODULE-DOCS)
  [M-CANONICAL-DOCS](../docs/#M-CANONICAL-DOCS).

- **Provide Thorough Examples**. Your documentation should have directly usable examples, the repository should include more elaborate ones.
  Follow
  [C-EXAMPLE](https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/checklist.html#c-example)
  [C-QUESTION-MARK](https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/checklist.html#c-question-mark).

- **Use Strong Types**. Avoid [primitive obsession](https://refactoring.guru/smells/primitive-obsession) by using strong types with strict well-documented semantics.
  Follow
  [C-NEWTYPE](https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/checklist.html#c-newtype).

- **Make Your APIs Testable**. Design APIs which allow your customers to test their use of your API in unit tests. This might involve introducing some mocks, fakes,
  or cargo features. AI agents need to be able to iterate quickly to prove that the code they are writing that calls your API is working
  correctly.

- **Ensure Test Coverage**. Your own code should have good test coverage over observable behavior.
  This enables agents to work in a mostly hands-off mode when refactoring.

## Avoid meta design documentation (M-NO-META-DESIGN-DOCUMENTATION) { #M-NO-META-DESIGN-DOCUMENTATION }

<why>docs focused on what is relevant to users.</why>

Crate and module documentation must be free of meta design narratives that were only relevant during the creation of a crate. In other words, it is the end-state that is to be documented, not the design journey.

Agents frequently produce sections that describe how a change was designed, "why we picked X over Y" essays, and design journals inside user-facing documentation. These artifacts might be interesting diagnostics while working on the project, but they are mostly meaningless to end users.

For example, an agent might append a self-report like this, summarizing which guidelines it claims to have followed:

```text
| Rule | Applied | Where |
| --- | :---: | --- |
| M-SHORT-NAMES | ✅ | Shortened method names across the data-access and HTTP handler layers. |
| M-WEASEL-WORDS | ✅ | Removed weasel words from type and field names throughout the public API. |
| M-PUBLIC-DISPLAY | ✅ | Added `Display` impls for all user-facing identifier and error types. |
| M-ASYNC-FN | ✅ | Migrated I/O-facing APIs from `impl Future` returns to `async fn`. |
```

This kind of content describes process, not behaviour, and goes stale over time. That said, it is of course perfectly reasonable to have a _Design Principles_ or similar section in the project's README, that on a high level describes the enduring architectural goals that are relevant to end users (e.g., a crate being allocation free, having an OSI architecture, or being designed with `#[no_std]` in mind).

## Rust code solves Rust problems (M-RUST-SHAPED) { #M-RUST-SHAPED }

<why>idiomatic code.</why>

When (automatically) porting C#, Java, C++, or similar code to Rust, technical constructs must not be copied 1-on-1.

It is prudent to separate domain aspects from language aspects. Domain aspects address business problems. An algorithm to compute prime numbers or logic for processing a customer table can (and should) work the same when translating between languages.

However, many patterns exist to solve problems particular to the ecosystem they stem from. The Rust ecosystem has its own problems, and these need to be addressed by idioms that work for Rust. These include

- error handling,
- management of tasks and threads,
- component abstractions and their lifetimes,
- ownership of parameters,
- the absence of 'object-oriented' programming,
- structural differences between interfaces and traits,
- and many others.

While some language constructs simply don't translate at all (e.g., compared to C#, Rust does not have any meaningful reflection), others are deceptively similar and might only bite months down the line (e.g., statics, compare [M-AVOID-STATICS](../libs/resilience/#M-AVOID-STATICS)).

As a rule of thumb, structs and their methods can have vaguely similar names, flows, inputs and outputs, as far as their business functionality is concerned. However, any striking technical similarity between Rust and { C#, Java, Python, ... } implementations is indicative of deeper architectural problems; a `throw_if_null()` never makes sense.

## Items are only visible through one path (M-SINGLE-ITEM-PATH) { #M-SINGLE-ITEM-PATH }

<why>a single, clutter-free path to each type.</why>

Public items within a crate should be reachable only through one path. For example some `crate::db::Connection` should not also be visible as `crate::Connection`:

```rust,ignore
// Not OK
pub mod db {
    pub struct Connection;
}

pub use db::Connection;
```

This rule is often violated by agents creating or refactoring large code bases over several iterations. In an attempt to _simplify_ their task, they re-export items under multiple paths, often previous ones from before some change, instead of cleanly redesigning structures where it makes sense.

Note this only targets the duplication of user-facing items. Within a crate it is acceptable (and often unavoidable) to see the same item multiple times as export trees are constructed:

```rust,ignore
// OK
pub(crate) mod db {
    pub struct Connection;
}

pub use db::Connection;
```

Similarly, re-exports of foreign items are not covered by this rule, although they should follow [M-FOREIGN-REEXPORTS](../libs/interop/#M-FOREIGN-REEXPORTS).

Likewise, this rule also does not apply to public-but-hidden `_private` modules needed by macros, compare [M-MACRO-HELPERS](../macros/#M-MACRO-HELPERS).

## Tests do not assert ground truth (M-TAUTOLOGICAL-TESTS) { #M-TAUTOLOGICAL-TESTS }

<why>tests that add value, not noise.</why>

Unit tests should verify meaningful behavior instead of repeating foundational definitions.

Agents frequently produce tests that re-state the expected value from the same logic the code under test uses, or that simply mirror the implementation's branches. Such tests pass by construction, provide virtually no value, but increase the noise floor of subsequent changes:

```rust
const CHECKPOINTS: [u32; 4] = [0, 90, 180, 270];

#[test]
fn checkpoints_are_correct() {
    assert_eq!(CHECKPOINTS, [0, 90, 180, 270]);
}
```

Where these are used to satisfy mutation tests, the mutation test should be skipped instead.

Instead, a meaningful test would check a property the constants are supposed to satisfy, for example that they are evenly spaced, monotonically increasing, or impose some direction in related logic.

# Application Guidelines

## Applications may use Anyhow or derivatives (M-APP-ERROR) { #M-APP-ERROR }

<why>simple application-level error handling.</why>

> Note, this guideline is primarily a relaxation and clarification of [M-ERRORS-CANONICAL-STRUCTS].

Applications, and crates in your own repository exclusively used from your application, may use [ohno::AppError](https://docs.rs/crate/ohno/latest#structs), [anyhow](https://github.com/dtolnay/anyhow),
[eyre](https://github.com/eyre-rs/eyre) or similar application-level error crates instead of implementing their own types.

For example, in your application crates you may just re-export and use eyre's common `Result` type, which should be able to automatically
handle all third party library errors, in particular the ones following
[M-ERRORS-CANONICAL-STRUCTS].

```rust,ignore
use ohno::AppError;

fn start_application() -> Result<(), AppError> {
    start_server()?;
    Ok(())
}
```

Once you selected your application error crate you should switch all application-level errors to that type, and you should not mix multiple
application-level error types.

Libraries (crates used by more than one crate) should always follow [M-ERRORS-CANONICAL-STRUCTS] instead.

[M-ERRORS-CANONICAL-STRUCTS]: ../libs/ux/#M-ERRORS-CANONICAL-STRUCTS

## Use mimalloc for apps (M-MIMALLOC-APPS) { #M-MIMALLOC-APPS }

<why>significant performance at no cost.</why>

Applications should set [mimalloc](https://crates.io/crates/mimalloc) as their global allocator. This usually results in notable performance
increases along allocating hot paths; we have seen up to 25% benchmark improvements.

Changing the allocator only takes a few lines of code. Add mimalloc to your `Cargo.toml` like so:

```toml
[dependencies]
mimalloc = { version = "0.1" } # Or later version if available
```

Then use it from your `main.rs`:

```rust,ignore
use mimalloc::MiMalloc;

#[global_allocator]
static GLOBAL: MiMalloc = MiMalloc;
```

## Applications target highest viable target-cpu (M-TARGET-CPU) { #M-TARGET-CPU }

<why>fleet performance.</why>

Server applications should compile against the highest `target-cpu` that the deployment environment is guaranteed to support, rather than defaulting to the generic baseline.

This can be achieved, for example, by setting inside `.cargo/config.toml`:

```toml
[target.x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu]
rustflags = ["-C", "target-cpu=x86-64-v3"]

[target.x86_64-pc-windows-msvc]
rustflags = ["-C", "target-cpu=x86-64-v3"]

# Add other platforms here based on needs ...
```

Note this guideline applies only to applications, as target settings are ignored for libraries.

---

# Correctness Guidelines

## Panic continuation is last resort (M-PANIC-CONTINUATION) { #M-PANIC-CONTINUATION }

<why>state integrity and freedom from subtle bugs.</why>

Panic recovery via `catch_unwind()` is a matter of last resort and must generally be followed by a controlled application restart.

Panics indicate the program has reached an unrecoverable state (compare [M-PANIC-IS-STOP](./#M-PANIC-IS-STOP) and [M-PANIC-ON-BUG](./#M-PANIC-ON-BUG)). Library code in particular should not attempt to catch a panic and continue execution, as there is a risk of observing otherwise impossible state:

```rust,ignore
thread_local! {
    static ALWAYS_EQUAL: RefCell<(i32, i32)> = RefCell::new((0, 0));
}

fn main() {
    let _ = panic::catch_unwind(|| {
        ALWAYS_EQUAL.with_borrow_mut(|p| {
            p.0 += 1;
            panic!("Assume some user-provided closure failed here");
            p.1 += 1;
        });
    });

    ALWAYS_EQUAL.with_borrow(|p| {
        assert_eq!(p.0, p.1);  // Broken!
    });
}
```

Although the example above is slightly contrived, the side effects and interactions of a caught panic can be harder to identify, can have wide blast radius, and be subtle.

Systems where many unrelated tasks are in flight (e.g., server request handlers) can use `catch_unwind` on a per-request basis, but should still promote an application restart after a request handler caused a panic. The purpose of `catch_unwind` here is not to continue execution indefinitely, but to allow all other requests to gracefully finish.

## Panic means 'stop the program' (M-PANIC-IS-STOP) { #M-PANIC-IS-STOP }

<why>soundness and predictability.</why>

Panics are not exceptions. Instead, they suggest immediate program termination.

Although your code must be [_minimally_ panic-safe](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/exception-safety.html) (i.e., a survived panic may not lead to
undefined state), invoking a panic means _this program should stop now_. It is not valid to:

- use panics to communicate (errors) upstream,
- use panics to handle self-inflicted error conditions,
- assume panics will be caught, even by your own code.

For example, if the application calling you is compiled with a `Cargo.toml` containing

```toml
[profile.release]
panic = "abort"
```

then any invocation of panic will cause an otherwise functioning program to needlessly abort. Valid reasons to panic are:

- when encountering a programming error, e.g., `x.expect("must never happen")`,
- anything invoked from const contexts, e.g., `const { foo.unwrap() }`,
- when user requested, e.g., providing an `unwrap()` method yourself,
- when encountering a poison, e.g., by calling `unwrap()` on a lock result (a poisoned lock signals another thread has panicked already).

Any of those are directly or indirectly linked to programming errors.

## Custom panics have a helpful message (M-PANIC-MESSAGE) { #M-PANIC-MESSAGE }

<why>faster bug diagnosis.</why>

When code panics intentionally (via `panic!`, `assert!`, `unreachable!`, `todo!`, or similar), a message must be present to clearly state what went wrong and, where applicable, include relevant values.

```rust,ignore
// Bad, the panic gives the developer little to act on.
assert!(buffer.len() >= HEADER_SIZE);

// Good, message contains reason and actual values.
assert!(buffer.len() >= HEADER_SIZE, "buffer too small for header: got {} bytes, need {HEADER_SIZE}", buffer.len());
```

Messages related to API misuse should be useful to the end user. Messages indicating bugs should be helpful to you-as-the-author, or whoever maintains the project after you, to quickly identify the underlying cause.

Panic messages in tests are not generally needed.

## Detected programming bugs are panics, not errors (M-PANIC-ON-BUG) { #M-PANIC-ON-BUG }

<why>tractable error handling and runtime consistency.</why>

As an extension of [M-PANIC-IS-STOP] above, when an unrecoverable programming error has been
detected, libraries and applications must panic, i.e., request program termination.

In these cases, no `Error` type should be introduced or returned, as any such error could not be acted upon at runtime.

Contract violations, i.e., the breaking of invariants either within a library or by a caller, are programming errors and must therefore panic.

However, what constitutes a violation is situational. APIs are not expected to go out of their way to detect them, as such
checks can be impossible or expensive. Encountering `must_be_even == 3` during an already existing check clearly warrants
a panic, while a function `parse(&str)` clearly must return a `Result`. If in doubt, we recommend you take inspiration from the standard library.

```rust, ignore
// Generally, a function with bad parameters must either
// - Ignore a parameter and/or return the wrong result
// - Signal an issue via Result or similar
// - Panic
// If in this `divide_by` we see that y == 0, panicking is
// the correct approach.
fn divide_by(x: u32, y: u32) -> u32 { ... }

// However, it can also be permissible to omit such checks
// and return an unspecified (but not an undefined) result.
fn divide_by_fast(x: u32, y: u32) -> u32 { ... }

// Here, passing an invalid URI is not a contract violation.
// Since parsing is inherently fallible, a Result must be returned.
fn parse_uri(s: &str) -> Result<Uri, ParseError> { };

```

> ### <tip></tip> Make it 'Correct by Construction'
>
> While panicking on a detected programming error is the 'least bad option', your panic might still ruin someone's day.
> For any user input or calling sequence that would otherwise panic, you should also explore if you can use the type
> system to avoid panicking code paths altogether.

## Unsafe implies undefined behavior (M-UNSAFE-IMPLIES-UB) { #M-UNSAFE-IMPLIES-UB }

<why>semantic consistency without warning fatigue.</why>

The marker `unsafe` may only be applied to functions and traits if misuse implies the risk of undefined behavior (UB).
It must not be used to mark functions that are dangerous to call for other reasons.

```rust
// Valid use of unsafe
unsafe fn print_string(x: *const String) { }

// Invalid use of unsafe
unsafe fn delete_database() { }
```

## Unsafe needs reason, should be avoided (M-UNSAFE) { #M-UNSAFE }

<why>memory safety and a minimal attack surface.</why>

You must have a valid reason to use `unsafe`. The only valid reasons are

1. novel abstractions, e.g., a new smart pointer or allocator,
1. performance, e.g., attempting to call `.get_unchecked()`,
1. FFI and platform calls, e.g., calling into C or the kernel, ...

Unsafe code lowers the guardrails used by the compiler, transferring some of the compiler's responsibilities
to the programmer. Correctness of the resulting code relies primarily on catching all mistakes in code review,
which is error-prone. Mistakes in unsafe code may introduce high-severity security vulnerabilities.

You must not use ad-hoc `unsafe` to

- shorten a performant and safe Rust program, e.g., 'simplify' enum casts via `transmute`,
- bypass `Send` and similar bounds, e.g., by doing `unsafe impl Send ...`,
- bypass lifetime requirements via `transmute` and similar.

Ad-hoc here means `unsafe` embedded in otherwise unrelated code. It is of course permissible to create properly designed, sound abstractions doing these things.

In any case, `unsafe` must follow the guidelines outlined below.

### Novel Abstractions

- [ ] Verify there is no established alternative. If there is, prefer that.
- [ ] Your abstraction must be minimal and testable.
- [ ] It must be hardened and tested against ["adversarial code"](https://cheats.rs/#adversarial-code), esp.
  - If they accept closures they must become invalid (e.g., poisoned) if the closure panics
  - They must assume any safe trait is misbehaving, esp. `Deref`, `Clone` and `Drop`.
- [ ] Any use of `unsafe` must be accompanied by plain-text reasoning outlining its safety
- [ ] It must pass [Miri](https://github.com/rust-lang/miri), including adversarial test cases
- [ ] It must follow all other [unsafe code guidelines](https://rust-lang.github.io/unsafe-code-guidelines/)

### Performance

- [ ] Using `unsafe` for performance reasons should only be done after benchmarking
- [ ] Any use of `unsafe` must be accompanied by plain-text reasoning outlining its safety. This applies to both
      calling `unsafe` methods, as well as providing `_unchecked` ones.
- [ ] The code in question must pass [Miri](https://github.com/rust-lang/miri)
- [ ] You must follow the [unsafe code guidelines](https://rust-lang.github.io/unsafe-code-guidelines/)

### FFI

- [ ] We recommend you use an established interop library to avoid `unsafe` constructs
- [ ] You must follow the [unsafe code guidelines](https://rust-lang.github.io/unsafe-code-guidelines/)
- [ ] You must document your generated bindings to make it clear which call patterns are permissible

## All code must be sound (M-UNSOUND) { #M-UNSOUND }

<why>predictable runtime behavior free of bugs and incompatibilities.</why>

Unsound code is seemingly _safe_ code that may produce undefined behavior when called from other safe code, or on its own accord.

> ### <tip></tip> Meaning of 'Safe'
>
> The terms _safe_ and `unsafe` are technical terms in Rust.
>
> A function is _safe_, if its signature does not mark it `unsafe`. That said, _safe_ functions can still be dangerous
> (e.g., `delete_database()`), and `unsafe` ones are, when properly used, usually quite benign (e.g.,`vec.get_unchecked()`).
>
> A function is therefore _unsound_ if it appears _safe_ (i.e., it is not marked `unsafe`), but if _any_ of its calling
> modes would cause undefined behavior. This is to be interpreted in the strictest sense. Even if causing undefined
> behavior is only a 'remote, theoretical possibility' requiring 'weird code', the function is unsound.
>
> Also see [Unsafe, Unsound, Undefined](https://cheats.rs/#unsafe-unsound-undefined).

```rust
// "Safely" converts types
fn unsound_ref<T>(x: &T) -> &u128 {
    unsafe { std::mem::transmute(x) }
}

// "Clever trick" to work around missing `Send` bounds.
struct AlwaysSend<T>(T);
unsafe impl<T> Send for AlwaysSend<T> {}
unsafe impl<T> Sync for AlwaysSend<T> {}
```

Unsound abstractions are never permissible. If you cannot safely encapsulate something, you must expose `unsafe` functions instead, and document proper behavior.

<div class="warning">

No Exceptions

While you may break most guidelines if you have a good enough reason, there are no exceptions in this case: unsound code is never acceptable.

</div>

> ### <tip></tip> It's the Module Boundaries
>
> Note that soundness boundaries equal module boundaries! It is perfectly fine, in an otherwise safe abstraction,
> to have safe functions that rely on behavior guaranteed elsewhere **in the same module**.
>
> ```rust
> struct MyDevice(*const u8);
>
> impl MyDevice {
>     fn new() -> Self {
>        // Properly initializes instance ...
>        # todo!()
>     }
>
>     fn get(&self) -> u8 {
>         // It is perfectly fine to rely on `self.0` being valid, despite this
>         // function in-and-by itself being unable to validate that.
>         unsafe { *self.0 }
>     }
> }
>
> ```

# Documentation

## Documentation has canonical sections (M-CANONICAL-DOCS) { #M-CANONICAL-DOCS }

<why>established Rust documentation practices.</why>

Public library items must contain the canonical doc sections. The summary sentence must always be present. Extended documentation and examples
are strongly encouraged. The other sections must be present when applicable.

```rust
/// Summary sentence < 15 words.
///
/// Extended documentation in free form.
///
/// # Examples
/// One or more examples that show API usage like so.
///
/// # Errors
/// If fn returns `Result`, list known error conditions
///
/// # Panics
/// If fn may panic, list when this may happen
///
/// # Safety
/// If fn is `unsafe` or may otherwise cause UB, this section must list
/// all conditions a caller must uphold.
///
/// # Abort
/// If fn may abort the process, list when this may happen.
pub fn foo() {}
```

In contrast to other languages, you should not create a table of parameters. Instead parameter use is explained in plain text. In other words, do not

```rust,ignore
/// Copies a file.
///
/// # Parameters
/// - src: The source.
/// - dst: The destination.
fn copy(src: File, dst: File) {}
```

but instead:

```rust,ignore
/// Copies a file from `src` to `dst`.
fn copy(src: File, dst: File) {}
```

### Related Reading

- Function docs include error, panic, and safety considerations ([C-FAILURE](https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/documentation.html#c-failure))

## Mark `pub use` items with `#[doc(inline)]` (M-DOC-INLINE) { #M-DOC-INLINE }

<why>re-exported items that fit in with their siblings.</why>

When publicly re-exporting crate items via `pub use foo::Foo` or `pub use foo::*`, they show up in an opaque re-export block. In most cases, this is not
helpful to the reader:

![TEXT](M-DOC-INLINE_BAD.png)

Instead, you should annotate them with `#[doc(inline)]` at the `use` site, for them to be inlined organically:

```rust,edition2021,ignore
# pub(crate) mod foo { pub struct Foo; }
#[doc(inline)]
pub use foo::*;

// or

#[doc(inline)]
pub use foo::Foo;
```

![TEXT](M-DOC-INLINE_GOOD.png)

This does not apply to `std` or 3rd party types; these should always be re-exported without inlining to make it clear they are external.

> ### <alert></alert> Still avoid glob exports
>
> The `#[doc(inline)]` trick above does not change [M-NO-GLOB-REEXPORTS]; you generally should not re-export items via wildcards.

[M-NO-GLOB-REEXPORTS]: ../libs/resilience/#M-NO-GLOB-REEXPORTS

## First sentence is one line; approx. 15 words (M-FIRST-DOC-SENTENCE) { #M-FIRST-DOC-SENTENCE }

<why>easily skimmable API docs.</why>

When you document your item, the first sentence becomes the "summary sentence" that is extracted and shown in the module summary:

```rust
/// This is the summary sentence, shown in the module summary.
///
/// This is other documentation. It is only shown in that item's detail view.
/// Sentences here can be as long as you like and it won't cause any issues.
fn some_item() { }
```

Since Rust API documentation is rendered with a fixed max width, there is a naturally preferred sentence length you should not
exceed to keep things tidy on most screens.

If you keep things in a line, your docs will become easily skimmable. Compare, for example, the standard library:

![TEXT](M-FIRST-DOC-SENTENCE_GOOD.png)

Otherwise, you might end up with _widows_ and a generally unpleasant reading flow:

![TEXT](M-FIRST-DOC-SENTENCE_BAD.png)

As a rule of thumb, the first sentence should not exceed **15 words**.

## Has comprehensive module documentation (M-MODULE-DOCS) { #M-MODULE-DOCS }

<why>easy API docs navigation.</why>

Any public library module must have `//!` module documentation, and the first sentence must follow [M-DOC-FIRST-SENTENCE].

```rust,edition2021,ignore
pub mod ffi {
    //! Contains FFI abstractions.

    pub struct String {};
}
```

The rest of the module documentation should be comprehensive, i.e., cover the most relevant technical aspects of the contained items, including

- what the module contains
- when it should be used, possibly when not
- examples
- subsystem specifications (e.g., `std::fmt` [also describes its formatting language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/fmt/index.html#formatting-parameters))
- observable side effects, including what guarantees are made about these, if any
- relevant implementation details, e.g., the used system APIs

Great examples include:

- [`std::fmt`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/fmt/index.html)
- [`std::pin`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/pin/index.html)
- [`std::option`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/option/index.html)

This does not mean every module should contain all of these items. But if there is something to say about the interaction of the contained types,
their module documentation is the right place.

# FFI Guidelines

## FFI crates follow established naming conventions (M-FFI-NAMING) { #M-FFI-NAMING }

<why>immediately recognizable crate roles across projects.</why>

Crates used for FFI should follow established naming practices:

- `-sys` for crates defining items to call into existing (C-style) libraries
- `-ffi` for crates defining (C-style) items when called from existing applications

There are slight variations of this scheme (e.g., `-sys2` when a previous `-sys` crate was abandoned and using `-` vs `_`), but overall `-ffi` clearly defines 'export' libraries, and `-sys` 'import' ones.

## Business logic belongs in core crates, FFI only translates (M-FFI-TRANSLATES) { #M-FFI-TRANSLATES }

<why>maximal safe code and a clean separation of concerns.</why>

When Rust is used to create FFI libraries, there should be a clear separation of concerns between the core _business logic_ crate `foo` and the glue crate `foo-ffi`.

Any operational functionality belongs in the core crate and should be expressed as idiomatic, safe, testable Rust. The FFI crate exists only to translate between native Rust and C constructs, and the core crate must not be infected with interop concerns, even if this means repeating, and slightly adjusting, type and function signatures. For example, given the following type in the core crate `foo`:

```rust,ignore
pub struct Message {
    destination: [u8; 8],
    data: Vec<u8>,
}

impl Message {
    pub fn new(destination: [u8; 8], data: Vec<u8>) -> Self { /* ... */ }
    pub fn transmit(&self) -> Result<(), TransmitError> { /* ... */ }
}
```

A proper separation of concerns might collapse construction and transmission into a single FFI entry point in `foo-ffi`:

```rust,ignore
#[no_mangle]
pub unsafe extern "C" fn transmit_message(
    destination: *const [u8; 8],
    data: *const u8,
    data_len: usize,
) -> u8 {
    let data = std::slice::from_raw_parts(data, data_len).to_vec();
    match Message::new(*destination, data).transmit() {
        Ok(()) => 0,
        Err(_) => 1,
    }
}
```

However, it would be improper to leak FFI requirements into `foo` itself: ownership, data models and signatures do not translate seamlessly between the two worlds. Any time _saved_ by skipping a clean split will have to be paid back many times over during refactorings down the line.

```rust
#[repr(C)]
pub struct Message {
    pub destination: [u8; 8],
    pub data_ptr: *mut u8,
    pub data_len: usize,
    pub data_cap: usize,
}
```

## Isolate DLL state between FFI libraries (M-ISOLATE-DLL-STATE) { #M-ISOLATE-DLL-STATE }

<why>data integrity and defined behavior across DLL boundaries.</why>

When loading multiple Rust-based dynamic libraries (DLLs) within one application, you may only share 'portable' state between these libraries.
Likewise, when authoring such libraries, you must only accept or provide 'portable' data from foreign DLLs.

Portable here means data that is safe and consistent to process regardless of its origin. By definition, this is a subset of FFI-safe types.
A type is portable if it is `#[repr(C)]` (or similarly well-defined), and _all_ of the following:

- It must not have any interaction with any `static` or thread local.
- It must not have any interaction with any `TypeId`.
- It must not contain any value, pointer or reference to any non-portable data (it is valid to point into portable data within non-portable data, such as
  sharing a reference to an ASCII string held in a `Box`).

_Interaction_ means any computational relationship, and therefore also relates to how the type is used. Sending a `u128` between DLLs is OK, using it to
exchange a transmuted `TypeId` isn't.

The underlying issue stems from the Rust compiler treating each DLL as an entirely new compilation artifact, akin to a standalone application. This means each DLL:

- has its own set of `static` and thread-local variables,
- the type layout of any `#[repr(Rust)]` type (the default) can differ between compilations,
- has its own set of unique type IDs, differing from any other DLL.

Notably, this affects:

- ⚠️ any allocated instance, e.g., `String`, `Vec<u8>`, `Box<Foo>`, ...
- ⚠️ any library relying on other statics, e.g., `tokio`, `log`,
- ⚠️ any struct not `#[repr(C)]`,
- ⚠️ any data structure relying on consistent `TypeId`.

In practice, transferring any of the above between libraries leads to data loss, state corruption, and usually undefined behavior.

Take particular note that this may also apply to types and methods that are invisible at the FFI boundary:

```rust,ignore
/// A method in DLL1 that wants to use a common service from DLL2
#[ffi_function]
fn use_common_service(common: &CommonService) {
    // This has at least two issues:
    // - `CommonService`, or ANY type nested deep within might have
    //   a different type layout in DLL2, leading to immediate
    //   undefined behavior (UB) ⚠️
    // - `do_work()` here looks like it will be invoked in DLL2, but
    //   the code executed will actually come from DLL1. This means that
    //   `do_work()` invoked here will see a data structure coming from
    //   DLL2, but will use statics from DLL1 ⚠️
    common.do_work();
}
```

# Library Guidelines

# Macros Guidelines

## Prefer 'macros by example' over proc macros (M-EXAMPLE-OVER-PROC) { #M-EXAMPLE-OVER-PROC }

<why>easy macro inspection and fast compilation.</why>

When a 'macro by example' can do the job, it should be preferred over proc macros.

Proc macros are more powerful, but their expansion can't easily be inspected. Where this versatility isn't needed, a simple 'macro by example' is the better option.

```rust,ignore
// Bad, attribute macro requires proc macro machinery, can be hard to
// inspect in some IDEs, and isn't needed here.
#[make_new_id]
struct MyId;

// Good, easier to write, maintain and inspect, faster compilation speed.
make_new_id!(MyId);
```

## Third party items come from hidden `_private` module (M-MACRO-HELPERS) { #M-MACRO-HELPERS }

<why>predictable compilation.</why>

When a macro expansion needs to refer to third-party items, the host crate should re-export those from a hidden module, and the macro should emit fully-qualified paths through that module rather than expecting the user's crate to depend on the third-party crate directly.

For example, a crate `foo` requiring `bar` traits would do:

```rust,ignore
#[doc(hidden)]
pub mod _private {
    pub use ::bar::Bar;
}

pub use foo_proc::my_macro;
```

The `my_macro!` implementation would then rely on its presence in its emitted code:

```rust,ignore
impl ::foo::_private::Bar for MyType { ... }
```

## Macros are a last resort (M-MACRO-LAST-RESORT) { #M-MACRO-LAST-RESORT }

<why>minimal complexity.</why>

Macros should only be used if no other viable solution exists, compare this adage:

> As @littlecalculist always told me, “macros are for when you run out of language”. If you still have language left — and Rust gives you a lot of language — use the language first.
>
> @pcwalton

Macros are powerful, but come with several downsides. They

- are magic, and it can be impossible to predict what they do, or how they do it,
- disproportionally increase compilation time in projects that otherwise don't rely on them,
- can cause subtle breakage at edition boundaries where Rust syntax and semantics can change.

Counterintuitively, the more structurally complex the result of a macro expansion is, the worse an idea it is to use macros for that in the first place. The ideal macro makes your users go "_I know exactly what this will generate, but I don't want to write all of that by hand_".

## Macros assume main crate (M-MACRO-MAIN-CRATE) { #M-MACRO-MAIN-CRATE }

<why>simple macro logic.</why>

Procedural macros can (and should) assume they are used through their main crate and emit paths for that.

For crates including proc macros it is common to ship them split in 3 for technical reasons:

- `foo` - the main crate that re-exports macros from `foo_proc`, along with extra traits or types,
- `foo_proc` - facade re-exporting macros from `foo_proc_impl` with `proc-macro = true`,
- `foo_proc_impl` - the actual macro implementation and unit tests.

In some cases there can be additional crates involved. Authors might be tempted to make `foo`, `foo_proc`, and siblings all work, resulting in complex re-export hierarchies or the use of 3rd party helpers. In reality, the minimal UX gain is usually not worth the added complexity (or compile time overhead), given the ecosystem precedent of mostly not supporting these usage modes in the first place.

This also implies you should not attempt to support use cases where your crate is imported under a different name.

## Macros don't lie about signatures (M-MACROS-DONT-LIE) { #M-MACROS-DONT-LIE }

<why>clarity for users and LLMs.</why>

Macros must not (make users) misrepresent signatures or the shape of items.

Macros have the ability to arbitrarily rewrite token streams. They could convert structs to enums, traits to functions, or perform any other transformation imaginable. They should, however, do none of that, as the resulting code will be highly confusing and virtually impossible to predict or reason about.

Among others, macros must not

- visibly convert the nature of data types (e.g., structs to enums, ...),
- alter function signatures,
- convert the `async`-ness of items,
- do anything else that materially detaches _what's written_ from _what's happening_.

```rust,ignore
// Bad: Adds extra parameter and marks function `async`. Impossible to
// predict from reading code.
#[magic_transform]
fn foo() { }

foo(token).await
```

## Proc macros should have separate impl crate incl. tests (M-PROC-IMPL) { #M-PROC-IMPL }

<why>thoroughly testable proc macros.</why>

Proc macros should be thin shims inside some `foo_proc` crate that delegate to a separate, regular library crate, usually called `foo_proc_impl`, which contains the actual token-stream transformation logic and its tests.

As proc macro crates are special, testing them from `foo_proc` usually requires workarounds for unit and snapshot tests. Instead, consider having a `foo_proc_impl` crate:

```rust,ignore
use proc_macro2::TokenStream;

pub fn my_macro(attr: TokenStream, item: TokenStream) -> TokenStream { ... }
```

These can come with regular [insta](https://insta.rs/) or similar snapshot tests, and are then exported as genuine proc macros via a `foo_proc` crate like so:

```rust,ignore
#[proc_macro_attribute]
pub fn my_macro(attr: TokenStream, item: TokenStream) -> TokenStream {
    foo_proc_impl::my_macro(attr.into(), item.into()).into()
}
```

The macros are then re-exported from the core crate:

```rust,ignore
pub use foo_proc::my_macro;
```

Inside the core crate, we also recommend adding [trybuild](https://docs.rs/trybuild/latest/trybuild/) UI tests with negative examples to ensure consistent error messages.

## Proc macros don't produce implied or hidden items (M-PROC-IMPLIED-ITEMS) { #M-PROC-IMPLIED-ITEMS }

<why>clear errors and correct hygiene and visibility.</why>

Macros should not define magic types on their own, in particular not public ones, or ones that don't rely on namespace tricks.

Some macros want to define types, for example

```rust,ignore
#[my_macro]
struct UserType;

// would expand to

struct UserType;
struct ExtraType;
impl UserType {
    fn foo() -> ExtraType { ... };
}
```

This is almost always a bad idea for several reasons:

- they can conflict with existing user-defined types inside the same module,
- if done naively, they can conflict with other expansions of the same macro,
- they can clash with the user's naming conventions,
- they are invisible at source code level and easily forgotten to be re-exported where needed.

While it is possible for users to work around these limitations somewhat, these are paper cuts your users will have to deal with, possibly months after the fact when refactoring otherwise unrelated code.

Note that there is one exception to this rule that has generally acceptable UX, the overloaded use of [namespaces](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/names/namespaces.html) made prominent by crates like Rocket:

```rust,ignore
#[my_macro]
fn foo() { ... }

// would expand to

fn foo() { ... }

struct foo;
impl SomeTrait for foo { ... }
```

Here a new type `foo` is introduced with the same name as the function `foo`. Due to Rust's namespace rules they can co-exist and are automatically re-exported with their parent, and due to [Rust's casing rules (C-CASE)](https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/naming.html#casing-conforms-to-rfc-430-c-case) these are highly unlikely to clash with user-defined types. However, they would still not make for a pretty _public_ type, and are therefore mainly used inside root crates to define request handlers or FFI functions.

# Performance Guidelines

## Hot `async` functions reduce stack size (M-ASYNC-STACK-SIZE) { #M-ASYNC-STACK-SIZE }

<why>small async stack sizes and low memcpy overhead.</why>

Functions marked `async` in the hot path should track their future sizes, and take one or more of the following steps to reduce their impact:

- reduction of parameter and rval type size,
- reduction of type size of items held across `.await` points,
- returning `impl Future` and extracting setup logic from `async {}` capture.

> ### <tip></tip> Future 'Stack' Sizes
>
> In Futures, what would naively be considered _their stack_, is actually part of a significantly more complicated machinery under their hood.
>
> Regular locals, that only live momentarily between two `.await` points, still remain part of the runtime thread's regular stack. However, any locals that live across `.await` points, or parameters passed during construction, become part of that Future's state machine type, and the layout of this type is currently not as optimized as it could be.
>
> This not only can cause stack-to-heap memcpy operations when creating or boxing Futures, it can also force large upfront stack sizes of the hypothetical most deeply nested cross-async call stack of the involved async function (which, on a side note, is why they can't simply recurse).
>
> ```rust,ignore
> async fn foo(_large: Large) {
>     let within_future = [0_u8; 1024]; // Crosses .await below, embedded in `foo` type
>     let on_stack = [0_u8; 1024]; // Does not cross .await points, lives on stack
>     let sneaky = Droppable::with_size(1024); // Secretly crosses .await point!
>     dbg!(&on_stack, &sneaky);
>     bar(&within_future).await;
>     dbg!(&within_future);
>     // <- `sneaky` dropped here, despite otherwise not being used!
> }
>
> let future = foo(Large::new()); // `Large` becomes embedded in `foo` type,
>                                 // blowing up its size, despite it not even
>                                 // being used.
>
> // Here, despite `foo` not running yet, we might consume up to `Large` +
> // 2kb of this thread's stack memory. Once we spawn this is memcpy'ed
> // to runtime Task structure:
> rt.spawn(future);
> ```

For many async functions this isn't an issue, as their associated `Future`-cost is negligible. However, functions used along the hot path, that are either called or instantiated frequently (e.g., 1000's of calls per second or concurrent tasks) might benefit from monitoring and optimizations.

Hot futures should be tracked via `size_of_val`:

```rust,ignore
async fn hot() { ... }

#[test]
fn has_reasonable_size() {
    let f = hot();
    assert!(size_of_val(&f) < ...); // Determine value / limit at first run.
}
```

Then consider a combination of the following:

```rust,ignore
// 1) Return an `impl Future` instead, this prevents large arguments
//    from infecting the future size, among others.
fn hot(args: Args) -> impl Future<Output = Result<T>> {
    // 2) Process arguments outside async context if processing does
    //    not require async functionality.
    let args = args.do_something();

    if args.invalid() {
        // 3) Use `Either` to return a single `impl Future` type, as
        //    otherwise you'd have to invent a new type.
        async { Err(InvalidArgs) }.left_future()
    } else {
        // 4) Chain future invocations via future helpers, which again
        //    prevents heavy locals from being passed through the state
        //    machine.
        read(args).then(|x| foo(x)).right_future()
    }
}
```

## Nested type hierarchies should avoid needless indirection (M-AVOID-INDIRECTION) { #M-AVOID-INDIRECTION }

<why>fast, cache-friendly memory access.</why>

Hot types should avoid nested heap indirection and consider lifting hot, cacheable deep fields to improve cache utilization.

While the gold standard is to benchmark, a pattern that emerges repeatedly when porting C# code to Rust is to reflexively `Arc` nested types, often multiple layers deep. Although this can make sense on very wide or heavyweight types that genuinely need to be shared by multiple owners, this pattern can ruin access latency when multiple rounds of DRAM lookup have to be performed sequentially.

Where nested, shared ownership isn't strictly needed, it is usually better to start with local, embedded data, and lift cacheable fields.

```rust,ignore
// Bad, `print` (assuming it is reasonably hot) needs 2 indirections
// to query whether it is enabled.
struct Item {
    config: Arc<Config>,
    payload: Payload,
}

struct Config {
    feature: Arc<Feature>
}

impl Item {
    fn print(&self) {
        if self.config.feature.is_enabled() { ... }
    }
}

// Better: `enabled` resides nearby and is likely immediately available
// once `print` is called.
struct Item {
    config: Arc<Config>,
    payload: Payload,
    enabled: bool,
}

impl Item {
    fn print(&self) {
        if self.enabled { ... }
    }
}

```

## Use boxed slices and strings for immutable owned sequences (M-BOX-DST) { #M-BOX-DST }

<why>low memory consumption and good cache utilization.</why>

Frequently used, internal, immutable sequences that will not be resized after construction should be stored as `Box<[T]>`, `Arc<str>` or similar, rather than their original `Vec<T>` or `String` counterparts.

Regular growable collections consist of a `(ptr, len, capacity)` triple. Converting them to boxed slices makes them immutable, executes a [shrink-to-fit](./#M-SHRINK-TO-FIT), and drops the `capacity` bit, reducing their handle size by 1/3. For this pattern to be useful, the following preconditions should apply:

- the sequence should be frequently instantiated (e.g., >1000's of instances),
- it must be immutable,
- it should not be user-visible, i.e., regular users would just deal with `&str` or similar.

Some collections provide dedicated methods for this, e.g., `String::into_boxed_str`.

```rust,ignore
// Bad, with many entries this wastes space and makes
// traversal ultimately slower.
struct Data {
    ids: Vec<String>
}

// Good, reduces memory consumption and fits more elements
// into cache.
struct Data {
    ids: Vec<Box<str>>
}
```

## Use a fast hasher where possible (M-FAST-HASHER) { #M-FAST-HASHER }

<why>hashing performance.</why>

When hashing trusted, internal keys, prefer a fast non-cryptographic hasher (e.g., `foldhash`, `FxHash`) over the standard library default.

Rust's default hasher is reasonably DoS safe on untrusted user input, but this comes at a performance penalty. If you can trust that keys are not maliciously crafted to overflow individual buckets, a custom fast hasher can yield significant performance gains.

````rust,ignore
// Bad, uses default hasher for keys we control.
let lookup = HashMap::<UserID, Data>::with_capacity(1024);

// Good, uses faster foldhash for internal keys.
let lookup = foldhash::HashMap<UserID, Data>::with_capacity(1024);



## Identify, profile, optimize the hot path early (M-HOTPATH) { #M-HOTPATH }

<why>high-performance code.</why>

You should, early in the development process, identify if your crate is performance or COGS relevant. If it is:

- identify hot paths and create benchmarks around them,
- regularly run a profiler collecting CPU and allocation insights,
- document or communicate the most performance sensitive areas.

For benchmarks we recommend [criterion](https://crates.io/crates/criterion) or [divan](https://crates.io/crates/divan).
If possible, benchmarks should not only measure elapsed wall time, but also used CPU time over all threads (this unfortunately
requires manual work and is not supported out of the box by the common benchmark utils).

Profiling Rust on Windows works out of the box with [Intel VTune](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/vtune-profiler.html)
and [Superluminal](https://superluminal.eu/). However, to gain meaningful CPU insights you should enable debug symbols for benchmarks in your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[profile.bench]
debug = 1
````

Documenting the most performance sensitive areas helps other contributors take better decision. This can be as simple as
sharing screenshots of your latest profiling hot spots.

## Collections are created with sufficient initial capacity (M-INITIAL-CAPACITY) { #M-INITIAL-CAPACITY }

<why>efficient collection creation.</why>

Where the final or approximate size of a collection (`Vec`, `String`, `HashMap`, `HashSet`, etc.) is known at construction time, it should be created via `with_capacity` rather than `new` or `default`.

Collections created without capacity may be re-allocated multiple times during their initialization, which also includes copying their content. Creating them with sufficient capacity can entirely avoid this needless overhead.

```rust,ignore
// Bad, probably re-allocates and copies content over multiple times.
let mut rval = Vec::new();
for x in &other {
    rval.push(convert(x));
}

// Better, creates collection with sufficient capacity upfront.
let mut rval = Vec::with_capacity(other.len());
for x in &other {
    rval.push(convert(x));
}
```

Iterator-driven construction (`collect`) inherits this behavior via `size_hint` and should be preferred over manual `push` loops when possible:

```rust,ignore
// Ideal, looks nicer and is performant
let rval: Vec<_> = other.iter().map(convert).collect();
```

## Library telemetry does not tank performance (M-LOG-OVERHEAD) { #M-LOG-OVERHEAD }

<why>low-overhead telemetry during diagnosis.</why>

Library code that emits telemetry should ensure that doing so does not meaningfully impact throughput or latency on the hot path.

Crates offered to 3rd parties emitting logs or metrics should assume telemetry will be permanently enabled, or under load. Care should therefore be taken that the volume and overhead of emitted events is reasonable, and will not cause excessive performance degradation.

Hot, inner loops should preferably stay free of telemetry emission entirely. If it can't be avoided, the events emitted should be lightweight and avoid allocations (e.g., `format!` string concatenation).

```rust,ignore
// Bad, logs each message and invokes allocation-based formatting.
for m in messages {
    log(format!("Emitting message {}", m.id()))
}

// Better, avoids per-message allocations.
for m in messages {
    log(("Emitting message", m.id()))
}

// Best: If possible, let telemetry users reconstruct what happened offline
log(("Processing message batch", messages.batch_id()))
for m in messages { ... }
```

## Reuse allocations where possible (M-MEM-REUSE) { #M-MEM-REUSE }

<why>low allocation overhead and fast hot paths.</why>

When designing APIs you should allow users to hold onto reusable resources. Inside your code you should make use of them where available.

The cost of repeated allocations inside hot loops can be significant, and from a user's perspective they can be invisible unless profiled:

```rust,ignore
// Bad, API design forces new allocation per element.
for id in ids {
    let value = db.get(id);
}
```

While this style of API may exist for convenience, it should be auxiliary. Instead, the core APIs should allow users to own the underlying object and re-use it:

```rust,ignore
// Good, allows users to decide whether a new allocation is needed.
let mut value = Value::new();
for id in ids {
    db.get_in(id, &mut value);
}
```

The canonical method on reusable types to reuse them is `.clear()`, as can be found on many `std` items. Multiple flavors of this pattern exist. In simple cases user-owned types can hold a preexisting, reusable collection directly:

```rust
struct Value {
    data: Vec<u8>
}
```

In heavyweight, deeply nested libraries it can be worthwhile to either pass a bump-style `Arena`, or to encapsulate one inside the user types, so it can be used throughout the call stack:

```rust,ignore
struct Query {
    arena: Arena,
    request: Request,
    data: Vec<u8>
}

fn client_do_work(query: &mut Query) {
    let request = rewrite_request(&query.request, &query.arena);
    get_in(request, &mut query.data);
}
```

## Shrink collections to fit after building (M-SHRINK-TO-FIT) { #M-SHRINK-TO-FIT }

<why>a minimal memory footprint.</why>

Where large, long-lived, growable collections such as `Vec` or `String` were built without an exact size reservation (compare [M-INITIAL-CAPACITY](./#M-INITIAL-CAPACITY)), the resulting collection should be shrunk via `shrink_to_fit` before storing it.

Many Rust collections grow by powers of two when iteratively adding elements. In the worst case a collection might therefore use ~2x of its needed memory.

```rust,ignore
// Bad, long lived object might end up using 2x needed memory.
let mut long_lived = Vec::new();
for x in large_iter {
    long_lived.push(x);
}

// Good, frees up extra memory.
long_lived.shrink_to_fit();
```

Note that this does not apply to conversions done via `into_boxed_*` and friends (compare [M-BOX-DST](./#M-BOX-DST)), as these generally shrink before converting already.

## Optimize for throughput, avoid empty cycles (M-THROUGHPUT) { #M-THROUGHPUT }

<why>COGS savings at scale.</why>

You should optimize your library for throughput, and one of your key metrics should be _items per CPU cycle_.

This does not mean to neglect latency&mdash;after all you can scale for throughput, but not for latency. However,
in most cases you should not pay for latency with _empty cycles_ that come with single-item processing, contended locks and frequent task switching.

Ideally, you should

- partition reasonable chunks of work ahead of time,
- let individual threads and tasks deal with their slice of work independently,
- sleep or yield when no work is present,
- design your own APIs for batched operations,
- perform work via batched APIs where available,
- yield within long individual items, or between chunks of batches (see [M-YIELD-POINTS]),
- exploit CPU caches, temporal and spatial locality.

You should not:

- hot spin to receive individual items faster,
- perform work on individual items if batching is possible,
- do work stealing or similar to balance individual items.

Shared state should only be used if the cost of sharing is less than the cost of re-computation.

[M-YIELD-POINTS]: ./#M-YIELD-POINTS

## Long-running tasks should have yield points (M-YIELD-POINTS) { #M-YIELD-POINTS }

<why>fair CPU time for all tasks.</why>

If you perform long running computations, they should contain `yield_now().await` points.

Your future might be executed in a runtime that cannot work around blocking or long-running tasks. Even then, such tasks are
considered bad design and cause runtime overhead. If your complex task performs I/O regularly it will simply utilize these await points to preempt itself:

```rust, ignore
async fn process_items(items: &[items]) {
    // Keep processing items, the runtime will preempt you automatically.
    for i in items {
        read_item(i).await;
    }
}
```

If your task performs long-running CPU operations without intermixed I/O, it should instead cooperatively yield at regular intervals, to not starve concurrent operations:

```rust, ignore
async fn process_items(zip_file: File) {
    let items = zip_file.read().async;
    for i in items {
        decompress(i);
        yield_now().await;
    }
}
```

If the number and duration of your individual operations are unpredictable you should use APIs such as `has_budget_remaining()` and
related APIs to query your hosting runtime.

> ### <tip></tip> Yield how often?
>
> In a thread-per-core model the overhead of task switching must be balanced against the systemic effects of starving unrelated tasks.
>
> Under the assumption that runtime task switching takes 100's of ns, in addition to the overhead of lost CPU caches,
> continuous execution in between should be long enough that the switching cost becomes negligible (<1%).
>
> Thus, performing 10 - 100μs of CPU-bound work between yield points would be a good starting point.

# Project Guidelines

## Common settings come from the workspace Cargo.toml (M-CARGO-WORKSPACE) { #M-CARGO-WORKSPACE }

<why>consistent, maintainable project configuration.</why>

Any repo with two or more crates that somehow belong together should unify these crates with a workspace `Cargo.toml`. Members then inherit shared metadata and dependency versions from the workspace root via `[workspace.dependencies]`, `[workspace.lints]`, ... rather than duplicating these values in each crate.

Where a dependency is crate-specific, it should still be defined in the workspace. Workspace definitions should generally not enable dependency features (except basic ones such as `["std"]`), and should instead use `default-features = false`.

## All crates are siblings in one folder (M-CRATES-FLAT-FOLDER) { #M-CRATES-FLAT-FOLDER }

<why>simple project navigation and a standard Rust layout.</why>

A repository should contain a single workspace `Cargo.toml`, and all Rust crates should be subordinate to it. All crates should then live in a single, direct subdirectory (e.g., `crates/`) below the workspace (for up to 1-2 dozen of crates), beyond that some folder hierarchy should be used (e.g., `common/`, `server/`, `client/`) to organize siblings.

```bash
# Ideal for most workspaces
Cargo.toml
crates/
  foo/Cargo.toml
  foo_core/Cargo.toml
  foo_proc/Cargo.toml
  foo_tests/Cargo.toml
  bar/Cargo.toml
  baz/Cargo.toml


# Ok for large workspaces
Cargo.toml
crates/
  server/
    main/Cargo.toml
    routes/Cargo.toml
  client/
    foo/Cargo.toml
    bar/Cargo.toml
  common/
    error/Cargo.toml
```

Placing crates inside other crates (at or below their `Cargo.toml`), or even inside their `src/` folder is never acceptable. If a crate relationship should be expressed, this is done via common prefixes instead (e.g., `foo`, `foo_util`, `foo_build`).

```bash
# Never acceptable, crates inside `src/` folder
Cargo.toml
crates/
  foo/Cargo.toml
    src/lib.rs
       deps/bar/Cargo.toml
```

Rare exceptions to this rule can occur if your crate is in the business of processing workspaces and has a collection of UI tests or similar it relies on; but even then these are usually dummy crates in nature.

## The workspace lists and versions all crates (M-CRATES-IN-WORKSPACE) { #M-CRATES-IN-WORKSPACE }

<why>simple inter-crate dependencies and debugging.</why>

Every crate produced by the project should be listed as a workspace member, and its version should be declared in `[workspace.dependencies]` so that intra-workspace dependencies resolve to a single canonical version.

```toml
# Bad, crate links its sibling directly
[dependencies]
sibling.path = "../sibling"


# Good, going through workspace
[dependencies]
sibling.workspace = true

[workspace.dependencies]
sibling = { path = "crates/sibling", version = "0.5.2" }
```

## New crates target latest edition (M-LATEST-EDITION) { #M-LATEST-EDITION }

<why>access to the latest Rust features.</why>

When creating a new crate or workspace, set `edition` to the latest stable edition (at least `2024` at the time of writing); the `resolver` field is generally not needed.

Using an older edition generally has no upsides for new projects, but forces you to write 'old Rust' that is less idiomatic and has worse UX edge cases. Notably, using an older edition does _not_ grant any compatibility benefits with the rest of the ecosystem. An application based on `2015` can use libraries written for `2024` just fine.

## MSRV is conservatively updated (M-MSRV) { #M-MSRV }

<why>modern features with stability for users.</why>

A Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) should be set when libraries are first created. It can be updated as new Rust features are needed, but should be kept a few versions behind the most recent compiler release.

The ecosystem expectation is that projects are compiled with a _reasonably modern_ Rust compiler.

Bumping MSRV therefore does not require a major release, but can be handled through a minor update (e.g., `1.3` to `1.4`). In fact, any project depending on 3rd party crates is already inherently bound to this contract; forcing a major version bump will not confer any benefits, but could possibly bifurcate downstream dependencies.

# Safety

# Universal Guidelines

## Magic values are documented (M-DOCUMENTED-MAGIC) { #M-DOCUMENTED-MAGIC }

<why>maintainability and safe refactoring.</why>

Hardcoded _magic_ values in production code must be accompanied by a comment. The comment should outline:

- why this value was chosen,
- non-obvious side effects if that value is changed,
- external systems that interact with this constant.

You should prefer named constants over inline values.

```rust, ignore
// Bad: it's relatively obvious that this waits for a day, but not why
wait_timeout(60 * 60 * 24).await // Wait at most a day

// Better
wait_timeout(60 * 60 * 24).await // Large enough value to ensure the server
                                 // can finish. Setting this too low might
                                 // make us abort a valid request. Based on
                                 // `api.foo.com` timeout policies.

// Best

/// How long we wait for the server.
///
/// Large enough value to ensure the server
/// can finish. Setting this too low might
/// make us abort a valid request. Based on
/// `api.foo.com` timeout policies.
const UPSTREAM_SERVER_TIMEOUT: Duration = Duration::from_secs(60 * 60 * 24);
```

## Lint overrides should use `#[expect]` (M-LINT-OVERRIDE-EXPECT) { #M-LINT-OVERRIDE-EXPECT }

<why>a current, tidy lint set.</why>

When overriding project-global lints inside a submodule or item, you should do so via `#[expect]`, not `#[allow]`.

Expected lints emit a warning if the marked warning was not encountered, thus preventing the accumulation of stale lints.
That said, `#[allow]` lints are still useful when applied to generated code, and can appear in macros.

Overrides should be accompanied by a `reason`:

```rust,edition2021
#[expect(clippy::unused_async, reason = "API fixed, will use I/O later")]
pub async fn ping_server() {
  // Stubbed out for now
}
```

## Use structured logging with message templates (M-LOG-STRUCTURED) { #M-LOG-STRUCTURED }

<why>low-cost logging with strong filtering.</why>

Logging should use structured events with named properties and message templates following
the [message templates](https://messagetemplates.org/) specification.

> **Note:** Examples use the [`tracing`](https://docs.rs/tracing/) crate's `event!` macro,
> but these principles apply to any logging API that supports structured logging (e.g., `log`,
> `slog`, custom telemetry systems).

### Avoid String Formatting

String formatting allocates memory at runtime. Message templates defer formatting until viewing time.
We recommend that message template includes all named properties for easier inspection at viewing time.

```rust,ignore
// Bad: String formatting causes allocations
tracing::info!("file opened: {}", path);
tracing::info!(format!("file opened: {}", path));

// Good: Message templates with named properties
event!(
    name: "file.open.success",
    Level::INFO,
    file.path = path.display(),
    "file opened: {{file.path}}",
);
```

> **Note**: Use the `{{property}}` syntax in message templates which preserves the literal text
> while escaping Rust's format syntax. String formatting is deferred until logs are viewed.

### Name Your Events

Use hierarchical dot-notation: `<component>.<operation>.<state>`

```rust,ignore
// Bad: Unnamed events
event!(
    Level::INFO,
    file.path = file_path,
    "file {{file.path}} processed succesfully",
);

// Good: Named events
event!(
    name: "file.processing.success", // event identifier
    Level::INFO,
    file.path = file_path,
    "file {{file.path}} processed succesfully",
);
```

Named events enable grouping and filtering across log entries.

### Follow OpenTelemetry Semantic Conventions

Use [OTel semantic conventions](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/) for common attributes if needed.
This enables standardization and interoperability.

```rust,ignore
event!(
    name: "file.write.success",
    Level::INFO,
    file.path = path.display(),         // Standard OTel name
    file.size = bytes_written,          // Standard OTel name
    file.directory = dir_path,          // Standard OTel name
    file.extension = extension,         // Standard OTel name
    file.operation = "write",           // Custom name
    "{{file.operation}} {{file.size}} bytes to {{file.path}} in {{file.directory}} extension={{file.extension}}",
);
```

Common conventions:

- HTTP: `http.request.method`, `http.response.status_code`, `url.scheme`, `url.path`, `server.address`
- File: `file.path`, `file.directory`, `file.name`, `file.extension`, `file.size`
- Database: `db.system.name`, `db.namespace`, `db.operation.name`, `db.query.text`
- Errors: `error.type`, `error.message`, `exception.type`, `exception.stacktrace`

### Redact Sensitive Data

Do not log plain sensitive data as this might lead to privacy and security incidents.

```rust,ignore
// Bad: Logs potentially sensitive data
event!(
    name: "file.operation.started",
    Level::INFO,
    user.email = user.email,  // Sensitive data
    file.name = "license.txt",
    "reading file {{file.name}} for user {{user.email}}",
);

// Good: Redact sensitive parts
event!(
    name: "file.operation.started",
    Level::INFO,
    user.email.redacted = redact_email(user.email),
    file.name = "license.txt",
    "reading file {{file.name}} for user {{user.email.redacted}}",
);
```

Sensitive data includes email addresses, file paths revealing user identity, filenames containing secrets or tokens,
file contents with PII, temporary file paths with session IDs and more. Consider using the [`data_privacy`](https://crates.io/crates/data_privacy) crate for consistent redaction.

## Public types are Debug (M-PUBLIC-DEBUG) { #M-PUBLIC-DEBUG }

<why>easy debugging without leaking sensitive data.</why>

All public types exposed by a crate should implement `Debug`. Most types can do so via `#[derive(Debug)]`:

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Endpoint(String);
```

Types designed to hold sensitive data should also implement `Debug`, but do so via a custom implementation.
This implementation must employ unit tests to ensure sensitive data isn't actually leaked, and will not be in the future.

```rust
use std::fmt::{Debug, Formatter};

struct UserSecret(String);

impl Debug for UserSecret {
    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut Formatter<'_>) -> std::fmt::Result {
        write!(f, "UserSecret(...)")
    }
}

#[test]
fn test() {
    let key = "552d3454-d0d5-445d-ab9f-ef2ae3a8896a";
    let secret = UserSecret(key.to_string());
    let rendered = format!("{:?}", secret);

    assert!(rendered.contains("UserSecret"));
    assert!(!rendered.contains(key));
}
```

## Public types meant to be read are Display (M-PUBLIC-DISPLAY) { #M-PUBLIC-DISPLAY }

<why>usability.</why>

If your type is expected to be read by upstream consumers, be it developers or end users, it should implement `Display`. This in particular includes:

- Error types, which are mandated by `std::error::Error` to implement `Display`
- Wrappers around string-like data

Implementations of `Display` should follow Rust customs; this includes rendering newlines and escape sequences.
The handling of sensitive data outlined in [M-PUBLIC-DEBUG] applies analogously.

[M-PUBLIC-DEBUG]: ./#M-PUBLIC-DEBUG

## Prefer regular over associated functions (M-REGULAR-FN) { #M-REGULAR-FN }

<why>readability.</why>

Associated functions should primarily be used for instance creation, not general purpose computation.

In contrast to some OO languages, regular functions are first-class citizens in Rust and need no module or _class_ to host them. Functionality that
does not clearly belong to a receiver should therefore not reside in a type's `impl` block:

```rust, ignore
struct Database {}

impl Database {
    // Ok, associated function creates an instance
    fn new() -> Self {}

    // Ok, regular method with `&self` as receiver
    fn query(&self) {}

    // Not ok, this function is not directly related to `Database`,
    // it should therefore not live under `Database` as an associated
    // function.
    fn check_parameters(p: &str) {}
}

// As a regular function this is fine
fn check_parameters(p: &str) {}
```

Regular functions are more idiomatic, and reduce unnecessary noise on the caller side. Associated trait functions are perfectly idiomatic though:

```rust
pub trait Default {
    fn default() -> Self;
}

struct Foo;

impl Default for Foo {
    fn default() -> Self { Self }
}
```

## Names of items are short (M-SHORT-NAMES) { #M-SHORT-NAMES }

<why>idiomatic code.</why>

The Rust convention that item identifiers are short should be followed:

- identifiers should not compound more than 2 short words (`AppConfig` over `GlobalApplicationConfig`),
- module or crate information shouldn't be baked into prefixes (`foo::Id` over `foo::FooId`), in particular when the direct 'super' item is sufficiently descriptive - in these cases users are expected to disambiguate items locally via qualifiers where needed (`fn convert(foo::Id) -> bar::Id`).
- abbreviations are preferred (`CallbackFn` over `CallbackFunction`),

Any of these rules can be broken where it makes local sense, but on a per-crate bases these exceptions should be _exceptional_ and well motivated.

## If in doubt, split the crate (M-SMALLER-CRATES) { #M-SMALLER-CRATES }

<why>fast compile times and good modularity.</why>

You should err on the side of having too many crates rather than too few, as this leads to dramatic compile time improvements—especially
during the development of these crates—and prevents cyclic component dependencies.

Essentially, if a submodule can be used independently, its contents should be moved into a separate crate.

Performing this crate split may cause you to lose access to some `pub(crate)` fields or methods. In many situations, this is a desirable
side-effect and should prompt you to design more flexible abstractions that would give your users similar affordances.

In some cases, it is desirable to re-join individual crates back into a single _umbrella crate_, such as when dealing with proc macros, or runtimes.
Functionality split for technical reasons (e.g., a `foo_proc` proc macro crate) should always be re-exported. Otherwise, re-exports should be used sparingly.

> ### <tip></tip> Features vs. Crates
>
> As a rule of thumb, crates are for items that can reasonably be used on their own. Features should unlock extra functionality that
> can't live on its own. In the case of umbrella crates, see below, features may also be used to enable constituents (but then that functionality

>
> For example, if you defined a `web` crate with the following modules, users only needing client calls would also have to pay for the compilation of server code:

> web::protocols

>
> Instead, you should introduce individual crates that give users the ability to pick and choose:
>
> ```text
> web_server
> web_client
> web_protocols
> ```

## Use static verification (M-STATIC-VERIFICATION) { #M-STATIC-VERIFICATION }

<why>consistency and freedom from common issues.</why>

Projects should use the following static verification tools to help maintain the quality of the code. These tools can be
configured to run on a developer's machine during normal work, and should be used as part of check-in gates.

- [compiler lints](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/lints/index.html) offer many lints to avoid bugs and improve code quality.
- [clippy lints](https://doc.rust-lang.org/clippy/) contain hundreds of lints to avoid bugs and improve code quality.
- [rustfmt](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt) ensures consistent source formatting.
- [cargo-audit](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-audit) verifies crate dependencies for security vulnerabilities.
- [cargo-hack](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-hack) validates that all combinations of crate features work correctly.
- [cargo-udeps](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-udeps) detects unused dependencies in Cargo.toml files.
- [miri](https://github.com/rust-lang/miri) validates the correctness of unsafe code.

### Compiler Lints

The Rust compiler generally produces exceptionally good diagnostics. In addition to the default set of diagnostics, projects
should explicitly enable the following set of compiler lints:

```toml
[lints.rust]
ambiguous_negative_literals = "warn"
missing_debug_implementations = "warn"
redundant_imports = "warn"
redundant_lifetimes = "warn"
trivial_numeric_casts = "warn"
unsafe_op_in_unsafe_fn = "warn"
unused_lifetimes = "warn"
```

### Clippy Lints

For clippy, projects should enable all major lint categories, and additionally enable some lints from the `restriction` lint group.
Undesired lints (e.g., numeric casts) can be opted back out of on a case-by-case basis:

```toml
[lints.clippy]
cargo = { level = "warn", priority = -1 }
complexity = { level = "warn", priority = -1 }
correctness = { level = "warn", priority = -1 }
pedantic = { level = "warn", priority = -1 }
perf = { level = "warn", priority = -1 }
style = { level = "warn", priority = -1 }
suspicious = { level = "warn", priority = -1 }
# nursery = { level = "warn", priority = -1 }  # optional, might cause more false positives

# Additional lints are from the `restriction` and `nursery` group that prevent specific
# constructs being used in source code in order to drive up consistency,
# quality, and brevity
allow_attributes_without_reason = "warn"
as_pointer_underscore = "warn"
assertions_on_result_states = "warn"
clone_on_ref_ptr = "warn"
deref_by_slicing = "warn"
disallowed_script_idents = "warn"
empty_drop = "warn"
empty_enum_variants_with_brackets = "warn"
empty_structs_with_brackets = "warn"
fn_to_numeric_cast_any = "warn"
if_then_some_else_none = "warn"
map_err_ignore = "warn"
redundant_type_annotations = "warn"
renamed_function_params = "warn"
semicolon_outside_block = "warn"
undocumented_unsafe_blocks = "warn"
unnecessary_safety_comment = "warn"
unnecessary_safety_doc = "warn"
unneeded_field_pattern = "warn"
unused_result_ok = "warn"
too_long_first_doc_paragraph = "warn"

# May cause issues with structured logging otherwise.
literal_string_with_formatting_args = "allow"

# Define custom opt outs here
# ...
```

## Follow the upstream guidelines (M-UPSTREAM-GUIDELINES) { #M-UPSTREAM-GUIDELINES }

<why>a codebase that reflects community lessons and does not surprise users or contributors.</why>

The guidelines in this book complement existing Rust guidelines, in particular:

- [Rust API Guidelines](https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/checklist.html)
- [Rust Style Guide](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/style-guide/)
- [Rust Design Patterns](https://rust-unofficial.github.io/patterns//intro.html)
- [Rust Reference - Undefined Behavior](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/behavior-considered-undefined.html)

We recommend you read through these as well, and apply them in addition to this book's items. Pay special attention to the ones below, as they are frequently forgotten:

- [ ] [C-CONV](https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/naming.html#ad-hoc-conversions-follow-as_-to_-into_-conventions-c-conv) - Ad-hoc conversions
      follow `as_`, `to_`, `into_` conventions
- [ ] [C-GETTER](https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/naming.html#getter-names-follow-rust-convention-c-getter) - Getter names follow Rust convention
- [ ] [C-COMMON-TRAITS](https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/interoperability.html#c-common-traits) - Types eagerly implement common traits
  - `Copy`, `Clone`, `Eq`, `PartialEq`, `Ord`, `PartialOrd`, `Hash`, `Default`, `Debug`
  - `Display` where type wants to be displayed
- [ ] [C-CTOR](https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/predictability.html?highlight=new#constructors-are-static-inherent-methods-c-ctor) -
      Constructors are static, inherent methods
  - In particular, have `Foo::new()`, even if you have `Foo::default()`
- [ ] [C-FEATURE](https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/naming.html#feature-names-are-free-of-placeholder-words-c-feature) - Feature names
      are free of placeholder words

## Names are free of weasel words (M-WEASEL-WORDS) { #M-WEASEL-WORDS }

<why>readability.</why>

Symbol names, especially type and trait names, should be free of weasel words that do not meaningfully
add information. Common offenders include `Service`, `Manager`, and `Factory`.

While your library may very well contain or communicate with a booking service&mdash;or even hold an `HttpClient`
instance named `booking_service`&mdash;one should rarely encounter a `BookingService` _type_ in code.

An item handling many bookings can just be called `Bookings`. If it does anything more specific, then that quality
should be appended instead. It submits these items elsewhere? Calling it `BookingDispatcher` would be more helpful.

The same is true for `Manager`s. All code manages _something_, so that moniker is rarely useful. With rare
exceptions, life cycle issues should likewise not be made the subject of some manager. Items are created in whatever
way they are needed, their disposal is governed by `Drop`, and only `Drop`.

Regarding factories, at least the term should be avoided. While the concept `FooFactory` has its use, its canonical
Rust name is `Builder` (compare [M-INIT-BUILDER](../libs/ux/#M-INIT-BUILDER)). A builder that can produce items repeatedly is still a builder.

In addition, accepting factories (builders) as parameters is an unidiomatic import of OO concepts into Rust. If
repeatable instantiation is required, functions should ask for an `impl Fn() -> Foo` over a `FooBuilder` or
similar. In contrast, standalone builders have their use, but primarily to reduce parametric permutation complexity
around optional values (again, [M-INIT-BUILDER](../libs/ux/#M-INIT-BUILDER)).

# Libraries / Building Guidelines

## Features are additive (M-FEATURES-ADDITIVE) { #M-FEATURES-ADDITIVE }

<why>reliable compilation in large, complex projects.</why>

All library features must be additive, and any combination must work, as long as the feature itself would work on the current platform. This implies:

- [ ] You must not introduce a `no-std` feature, use a `std` feature instead
- [ ] Adding any feature `foo` must not disable or modify any public item
  - Adding enum variants is fine if these enums are `#[non_exhaustive]`
- [ ] Features must not rely on other features to be manually enabled
- [ ] Features must not rely on their parent to skip-enable a feature in one of their children

Further Reading

- [Feature Unification](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/features.html#feature-unification)
- [Mutually Exclusive Features](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/features.html#mutually-exclusive-features)

## Libraries work out of the box (M-OOBE) { #M-OOBE }

<why>easy adoption across the Rust ecosystem.</why>

Libraries must _just work_ on all supported platforms, with the exception of libraries that are expressly platform or target specific.

Rust crates often come with dozens of dependencies, applications with 100's. Users expect `cargo build` and `cargo install`
to _just work_. Consider this installation of `bat` that pulls in ~250 dependencies:

```text
Compiling writeable v0.5.5
Compiling strsim v0.11.1
Compiling litemap v0.7.5
Compiling crossbeam-utils v0.8.21
Compiling icu_properties_data v1.5.1
Compiling ident_case v1.0.1
Compiling once_cell v1.21.3
Compiling icu_normalizer_data v1.5.1
Compiling fnv v1.0.7
Compiling regex-syntax v0.8.5
Compiling anstyle v1.0.10
Compiling vcpkg v0.2.15
Compiling utf8parse v0.2.2
Compiling aho-corasick v1.1.3
Compiling utf16_iter v1.0.5
Compiling hashbrown v0.15.2
Building [==>                       ] 29/251: icu_locid_transform_data, serde, winnow, indexma...
```

This compilation, like practically all other applications and libraries, will _just work_.

While there are tools targeting specific functionality (e.g., a Wayland compositor) or platform crates like
`windows`; unless a crate is _obviously_ platform specific, the expectation is that it will otherwise _just work_.

This means crates must build, ultimately

- [ ] on all [Tier 1 platforms](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/platform-support.html),<sup>1</sup> and
- [ ] without any additional prerequisites beyond `cargo` and `rust`.<sup>2</sup>

<footnotes>

<sup>1</sup> It is ok to not support Tier 1 platforms "for now", but abstractions must be present so support can easily be extended. This is usually
done by introducing an internal `HAL` ([Hardware Abstraction Layer](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HAL_(software)>)) module with a `dummy` fallback target.<br/>
<sup>2</sup> A default Rust installation will also have `cc` and a linker present.

</footnotes>

In particular, non-platform crates must not, by default, require the user to install additional tools, or expect environment variables
to compile. If tools were somehow needed (like the generation of Rust from `.proto` files) these tools should be run as part of the
publishing workflow or earlier, and the resulting artifacts (e.g., `.rs` files) be contained inside the published crate.

If a dependency is known to be platform specific, the parent must use conditional (platform) compilation or opt-in feature gates.

## Native `-sys` crates compile without dependencies (M-SYS-CRATES) { #M-SYS-CRATES }

<why>libraries that just work on all platforms.</why>

If you author a pair of `foo` and `foo-sys` crates wrapping a native `foo.lib`, you are likely to run into the issues described
in [M-OOBE].

Follow these steps to produce a crate that _just works_ across platforms:

- [ ] fully govern the build of `foo.lib` from `build.rs` inside `foo-sys`. Only use hand-crafted compilation via the
      [cc](https://crates.io/crates/cc) crate, do _not_ run Makefiles or external build scripts, as that will require the installation of external dependencies,
- [ ] make all external tools optional, such as `nasm`,
- [ ] embed the upstream source code in your crate,
- [ ] make the embedded sources verifiable (e.g., include Git URL + hash),
- [ ] pre-generate `bindgen` glue if possible,
- [ ] support both static linking, and dynamic linking via [libloading](https://crates.io/crates/libloading).

Deviations from these points can work, and can be considered on a case-by-case basis:

If the native build system is available as an _OOBE_ crate, that can be used instead of `cc` invocations. The same applies to external tools.

Source code might have to be downloaded if it does not fit crates.io size limitations. In any case, only servers with an availability
comparable to crates.io should be used. In addition, the specific hashes of acceptable downloads should be stored in the crate and verified.

Downloading sources can fail on hermetic build environments, therefore alternative source roots should also be specifiable (e.g., via environment variables).

# Libraries / Interoperability Guidelines

## Don't leak external types (M-DONT-LEAK-TYPES) { #M-DONT-LEAK-TYPES }

<why>stable APIs and low long-term maintenance cost.</why>

Where possible, you should prefer `std`<sup>1</sup> types in public APIs over types coming from external crates. Exceptions should be carefully considered.

Any type in any public API will become part of that API's contract. Since `std` and constituents are the only crates
shipped by default, and since they come with a permanent stability guarantee, their types are the only ones that come without an interoperability risk.

A crate that exposes another crate's type is said to _leak_ that type.

For maximal long term stability your crate should, theoretically, not leak any types. Practically, some leakage
is unavoidable, sometimes even beneficial. We recommend you follow this heuristic:

## Native escape hatches (M-ESCAPE-HATCHES) { #M-ESCAPE-HATCHES }

<why>workarounds for unsupported use cases until alternatives exist.</why>

Types wrapping native handles should provide `unsafe` escape hatches. In interop scenarios your users might have gotten a native handle from somewhere
else, or they might have to pass your wrapped handle over FFI. To enable these use cases you should provide `unsafe` conversion methods.

```rust
# type HNATIVE = *const u8;
pub struct Handle(HNATIVE);

impl Handle {
    pub fn new() -> Self {
        // Safely creates handle via API calls
        # todo!()
    }

    // Constructs a new Handle from a native handle the user got elsewhere.
    // This method  should then also document all safety requirements that
    // must be fulfilled.
    pub unsafe fn from_native(native: HNATIVE) -> Self {
        Self(native)
    }

    // Various extra methods to permanently or temporarily obtain
    // a native handle.
    pub fn into_native(self) -> HNATIVE { self.0 }
    pub fn to_native(&self) -> HNATIVE { self.0 }
}
```

## Items come from their original crate (M-FOREIGN-REEXPORTS) { #M-FOREIGN-REEXPORTS }

<why>unambiguous type identity.</why>

Crates should generally not re-export items from other crates. For example, if your crate contains a method `foo::download(url: bar::Url)`, you should not do `pub use bar::Url` from inside `foo`. This avoids having possibly dozens of aliases in context, which can get confusing for both users and agents, in particular if these are mixed with genuinely different types of the same name from other crates.

When a crate accepts or returns a type defined in some third-party crate, users are expected to depend on that third-party crate directly and import the type from there. That said, there are a few valid exceptions to this rule:

- Umbrella crates (compare [M-DONT-LEAK-TYPES](./#M-DONT-LEAK-TYPES)) by definition re-export other types
- Crates split for technical reasons (e.g., exporting `foo_core::Url` from `foo`)
- Macro use to provide stable paths, e.g., via some hidden `foo::__private::Url`

## Accept `impl AsRef<>` where feasible (M-IMPL-ASREF) { #M-IMPL-ASREF }

<why>flexibility for callers to use their own types.</why>

In **function** signatures, accept `impl AsRef<T>` for types that have a
[clear reference hierarchy](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/convert/trait.AsRef.html#implementors), where you
do not need to take ownership, or where object creation is relatively cheap.

| Instead of ...     | accept ...         |
| ------------------ | ------------------ |
| `&str`, `String`   | `impl AsRef<str>`  |
| `&Path`, `PathBuf` | `impl AsRef<Path>` |
| `&[u8]`, `Vec<u8>` | `impl AsRef<[u8]>` |

```rust,ignore
# use std::path::Path;
// Definitely use `AsRef`, the function does not need ownership.
fn print(x: impl AsRef<str>) {}
fn read_file(x: impl AsRef<Path>) {}
fn send_network(x: impl AsRef<[u8]>) {}

// Further analysis needed. In these cases the function wants
// ownership of some `String` or `Vec<u8>`. If those are
// "low freqency, low volume" functions `AsRef` has better ergonomics,
// otherwise accepting a `String` or `Vec<u8>` will have better
// performance.
fn new_instance(x: impl AsRef<str>) -> HoldsString {}
fn send_to_other_thread(x: impl AsRef<[u8]>) {}
```

In contrast, **types** should generally not be infected by these bounds:

```rust,ignore
// Generally not ok. There might be exceptions for performance
// reasons, but those should not be user visible.
struct User<T: AsRef<str>> {
    name: T
}

// Better
struct User {
    name: String
}
```

## Accept `impl 'IO'` where feasible ('sans IO') (M-IMPL-IO) { #M-IMPL-IO }

<why>business logic untangled from I/O, with N*M composability.</why>

Functions and types that only need to perform one-shot I/O during initialization should be written "[sans-io](https://www.firezone.dev/blog/sans-io)",
and accept some `impl T`, where `T` is the appropriate I/O trait, effectively outsourcing I/O work to another type:

```rust,ignore
// Bad, caller must provide a File to parse the given data. If this
// data comes from the network, it'd have to be written to disk first.
fn parse_data(file: File) {}
```

```rust
// Much better, accepts
// - Files,
// - TcpStreams,
// - Stdin,
// - &[u8],
// - UnixStreams,
// ... and many more.
fn parse_data(data: impl std::io::Read) {}
```

Synchronous functions should use [`std::io::Read`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/io/trait.Read.html) and
[`std::io::Write`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/io/trait.Write.html). Asynchronous _functions_ targeting more than one runtime should use
[`futures::io::AsyncRead`](https://docs.rs/futures/latest/futures/io/trait.AsyncRead.html) and similar.
_Types_ that need to perform runtime-specific, continuous I/O should follow [M-RUNTIME-ABSTRACTED] instead.

[M-RUNTIME-ABSTRACTED]: ./#M-RUNTIME-ABSTRACTED

## Accept `impl RangeBounds<>` where feasible (M-IMPL-RANGEBOUNDS) { #M-IMPL-RANGEBOUNDS }

<why>flexibility and clarity when specifying ranges.</why>

Functions that accept a range of numbers must use a `Range` type or trait over hand-rolled parameters:

```rust,ignore
// Bad
fn select_range(low: usize, high: usize) {}
fn select_range(range: (usize, usize)) {}
```

In addition, functions that can work on arbitrary ranges, should accept `impl RangeBounds<T>` rather than `Range<T>`.

```rust
# use std::ops::{RangeBounds, Range};
// Callers must call with `select_range(1..3)`
fn select_range(r: Range<usize>) {}

// Callers may call as
//     select_any(1..3)
//     select_any(1..)
//     select_any(..)
fn select_any(r: impl RangeBounds<usize>) {}
```

## Types are Send (M-TYPES-SEND) { #M-TYPES-SEND }

<why>use in Tokio and behind runtime abstractions.</why>

Public types should be `Send` for compatibility reasons:

- All futures produced (explicitly or implicitly) must be `Send`
- Most other types should be `Send`, but there might be exceptions

### Futures

When declaring a future explicitly you should ensure it is, and remains, `Send`.

```rust
# use std::future::Future;
# use std::pin::Pin;
# use std::task::{Context, Poll};
#
struct Foo {}

impl Future for Foo {
    // Explicit implementation of `Future` for your type
    # type Output = ();
    #
    # fn poll(self: Pin<&mut Self>, _: &mut Context<'_>) -> Poll<<Self as Future>::Output> { todo!() }
}

// You should assert your type is `Send`
const fn assert_send<T: Send>() {}
const _: () = assert_send::<Foo>();
```

When returning futures implicitly through `async` method calls, you should make sure these are `Send` too.
You do not have to test every single method, but you should at least validate your main entry points.

```rust,edition2021
async fn foo() { }

// TODO: We want this as a macro as well
fn assert_send<T: Send>(_: T) {}
_ = assert_send(foo());
```

### Regular Types

Most regular types should be `Send`, as they otherwise infect futures turning them `!Send` if held across `.await` points.

```rust,edition2021
# use std::rc::Rc;
# async fn read_file(x: &str) {}
#
async fn foo() {
    let rc = Rc::new(123);      // <-- Holding this across an .await point prevents
    read_file("foo.txt").await; //     the future from being `Send`.
    dbg!(rc);
}
```

That said, if the default use of your type is _instantaneous_, and there is no reason for it to be otherwise held across `.await` boundaries, it may be `!Send`.

```rust,edition2021
# use std::rc::Rc;
# struct Telemetry; impl Telemetry { fn ping(&self, _: u32) {} }
# fn telemetry() -> Telemetry  { Telemetry }
# async fn read_file(x: &str) {}
#
async fn foo() {
    // Here a hypothetical instance Telemetry is summoned
    // and used ad-hoc. It may be ok for Telemetry to be !Send.
    telemetry().ping(0);
    read_file("foo.txt").await;
    telemetry().ping(1);
}
```

# Libraries / Resilience Guidelines

## Avoid statics (M-AVOID-STATICS) { #M-AVOID-STATICS }

<why>consistency and correctness across crate versions.</why>

Libraries should avoid `static` and thread-local items, if a consistent view of the item is relevant for correctness.
Essentially, any code that would be incorrect if the static _magically_ had another value must not use them. Statics
only used for performance optimizations are ok.

The fundamental issue with statics in Rust is the secret duplication of state.

Consider a crate `core` with the following function:

```rust
# use std::sync::atomic::AtomicUsize;
# use std::sync::atomic::Ordering;
static GLOBAL_COUNTER: AtomicUsize = AtomicUsize::new(0);

pub fn increase_counter() -> usize {
    GLOBAL_COUNTER.fetch_add(1, Ordering::Relaxed)
}
```

Now assume you have a crate `main`, calling two libraries `library_a` and `library_b`, each invoking that counter:

```rust,ignore
// Increase global static counter 2 times
library_a::count_up();
library_a::count_up();

// Increase global static counter 3 more times
library_b::count_up();
library_b::count_up();
library_b::count_up();
```

They eventually report their result:

```rust,ignore
library_a::print_counter();
library_b::print_counter();
main::print_counter();
```

At this point, what is _the_ value of said counter; `0`, `2`, `3` or `5`?

The answer is, possibly any (even multiple!) of the above, depending on the crate's version resolution!

Under the hood Rust may link to multiple versions of the same crate, independently instantiated, to satisfy declared
dependencies. This is especially observable during a crate's `0.x` version timeline, where each `x` constitutes a separate _major_ version.

If `main`, `library_a` and `library_b` all declared the same version of `core`, e.g. `0.5`, then the reported result will be `5`, since all
crates actually _see_ the same version of `GLOBAL_COUNTER`.

However, if `library_a` declared `0.4` instead, then it would be linked against a separate version of `core`; thus `main` and `library_b` would
agree on a value of `3`, while `library_a` reported `2`.

Although `static` items can be useful, they are particularly dangerous before a library's stabilization, and for any state where _secret duplication_ would
cause consistency issues when static and non-static variable use interacts. In addition, statics interfere with unit testing, and are a contention point in
thread-per-core designs.

## Builders validate in final `.build()` (M-BUILD-RESULT) { #M-BUILD-RESULT }

<why>clean builder error handling.</why>

A builder's per-field setters should accept input without failing, final validation should be done by `.build()`.

Fallible setters add noise, and still don't guard against interdependent error conditions. Where builders are fallible they should offer a `Result`-carrying `.build()` instead.

```rust,ignore
// Bad, forces repeated error checks that provide no value.
Foo::builder()
    .name("Foo")?
    .distance(42)?
    .build();

// Good, consolidates sanity checking and allows for cross-checks
// between properties.
Foo::builder()
    .name("Foo")
    .distance(42)
    .build()?;
```

That said, individual settings should prefer strong types carrying their own validation where applicable, compare M-STRONG-TYPES-GUARD.

## Integration tests live under `tests/` (M-INTEGRATION-TESTS) { #M-INTEGRATION-TESTS }

<why>clean code files.</why>

Tests that only touch public API surface are _integration tests_ and belong under `tests/`, not `mod tests {}`.

In projects with coverage targets, it is not uncommon for `src/` files to contain more testing code than actual business logic. This can make browsing and understanding the code harder both in IDEs and PRs. Likewise, if a testing goal can be achieved through either an integration test or a unit test, the former is always preferred.

## Production code uses telemetry, not println (M-LOG-NOT-PRINT) { #M-LOG-NOT-PRINT }

<why>diagnostics available where they are needed.</why>

Production code paths should emit diagnostics through the project's telemetry framework rather than via `println!` or `dbg!`. Console output is reserved for CLIs that intentionally write to stdout as their user interface.

## I/O and system calls are mockable (M-MOCKABLE-SYSCALLS) { #M-MOCKABLE-SYSCALLS }

<why>testable edge cases that are otherwise hard to evoke.</why>

Any user-facing type doing I/O, or sys calls with side effects, should be mockable to these effects. This includes file and
network access, clocks, entropy sources and seeds, and similar. More generally, any operation that is

- non-deterministic,
- reliant on external state,
- depending on the hardware or the environment,
- is otherwise fragile or not universally reproducible

should be mockable.

> ### <tip></tip> Mocking Allocations?
>
> Unless you write kernel code or similar, you can consider allocations to be deterministic, hardware independent and practically

>
> However, this does _not_ mean you should expect there to be unlimited memory available. While it is ok to

This guideline has several implications for libraries, they

- should not perform ad-hoc I/O, i.e., call `read("foo.txt")`
- should not rely on non-mockable I/O and sys calls
- should not create their own I/O or sys call _core_ themselves
- should not offer `MyIoLibrary::default()` constructors

Instead, libraries performing I/O and sys calls should either accept some I/O _core_ that is mockable already, or provide mocking functionality themselves:

```rust, ignore
let lib = Library::new_runtime(runtime_io); // mockable I/O functionality passed in
let (lib, mock) = Library::new_mocked(); // supports inherent mocking
```

Libraries supporting inherent mocking should implement it as follows:

```rust, ignore
pub struct Library {
    some_core: LibraryCore // Encapsulates syscalls, I/O, ... compare below.
}

impl Library {
    pub fn new() -> Self { ... }
    pub fn new_mocked() -> (Self, MockCtrl) { ... }
}
```

Behind the scenes, `LibraryCore` is a non-public enum, similar to [M-RUNTIME-ABSTRACTED], that either dispatches
calls to the respective sys call, or to an mocking controller.

```rust, ignore
// Dispatches calls either to the operating system, or to a
// mocking controller.
enum LibraryCore {
    Native,

    #[cfg(feature = "test-util")]
    Mocked(mock::MockCtrl)
}

impl LibraryCore {
    // Some function you'd forward to the operating system.
    fn random_u32(&self) {
        match self {
            Self::Native => unsafe { os_random_u32() }
            Self::Mocked(m) => m.random_u32()
        }
    }
}


#[cfg(feature = "test-util")]
mod mock {
    // This follows the M-SERVICES-CLONE pattern, so both `LibraryCore` and
    // the user can hold on to the same `MockCtrl` instance.
    pub struct MockCtrl {
        inner: Arc<MockCtrlInner>
    }

    // Implement required logic accordingly, usually forwarding to
    // `MockCtrlInner` below.
    impl MockCtrl {
        pub fn set_next_u32(&self, x: u32) { ... }
        pub fn random_u32(&self) { ... }
    }

    // Contains actual logic, e.g., the next random number we should return.
    struct MockCtrlInner {
        next_call: u32
    }
}
```

Runtime-aware libraries already build on top of the [M-RUNTIME-ABSTRACTED] pattern should extend their runtime enum instead:

```rust, ignore
enum Runtime {
    #[cfg(feature="tokio")]
    Tokio(tokio::Tokio),

    #[cfg(feature="smol")]
    Smol(smol::Smol)

    #[cfg(feature="test-util")]
    Mock(mock::MockCtrl)
}
```

As indicated above, most libraries supporting mocking should not accept mock controllers, but return them via parameter tuples,
with the first parameter being the library instance, the second the mock controller. This is to prevent state ambiguity if multiple
instances shared a single controller:

```rust, ignore
impl Library {
    pub fn new_mocked() -> (Self, MockCtrl) { ... } // good
    pub fn new_mocked_bad(&mut MockCtrl) -> Self { ... } // prone to misuse
}
```

[M-RUNTIME-ABSTRACTED]: ../ux/#M-RUNTIME-ABSTRACTED

## Don't glob re-export items (M-NO-GLOB-REEXPORTS) { #M-NO-GLOB-REEXPORTS }

<why>a deliberate public surface.</why>

Don't `pub use foo::*` from other modules, especially not from other crates. You might accidentally export more than you want,
and globs are hard to review in PRs. Re-export items individually instead:

```rust,ignore
pub use foo::{A, B, C};
```

Glob exports are permissible for technical reasons, like doing platform specific re-exports from a set of HAL (hardware abstraction layer) modules:

```rust,ignore
#[cfg(target_os = "windows")]
mod windows { /* ... */ }

#[cfg(target_os = "linux")]
mod linux { /* ... */ }

// Acceptable use of glob re-exports, this is a common pattern
// and it is clear everything is just forwarded from a single
// platform.

#[cfg(target_os = "windows")]
pub use windows::*;

#[cfg(target_os = "linux")]
pub use linux::*;
```

## Newtypes guard their invariants (M-STRONG-TYPES-GUARD) { #M-STRONG-TYPES-GUARD }

<why>centralized correctness invariants.</why>

When introducing a strong type or newtype that exists to encode an invariant (a non-empty string, a percentage, a port number, a sanitized path, ...), the type itself must enforce that invariant where applicable.

Construction should be fallible, returning a proper error when the invariant cannot be upheld, rather than handing the responsibility off to every user:

```rust,ignore
// Bad, creates a new type but enforces nothing. Every caller now has to
// re-check that the value is actually a valid month, defeating the point of
// having a dedicated type.
pub struct Month(pub u8);

impl Month {
    pub fn new(value: u8) -> Self { ... }
}


// Good, the invariant (1..=12) is checked once, at the boundary, and
// every later use of `Month` can rely on it.
pub struct Month(u8);

impl Month {
    pub fn from_u8(value: u8) -> Result<Self, DateError> { ... }
}
```

This means for any newtype that is non-total:

- It must have at least one fallible constructor (e.g., `fn from_foo(...) -> Result<Self, _>`).
- Additional panicking constructors are allowed (e.g., `new`), and should preferably be `const`.
- Conversions from weaker types into the newtype must be fallible (`TryFrom`/`FromStr`).
- Infallible `From` implementations may not be offered.

> ### <tip></tip> Why `const`?
>
> Const constructors allows them to be used inside `const {}` blocks, which surfaces these violations as errors. This enables
> users to do `let month_due = const { Month::new(14) }` and avoids hitting these paths during runtime.

## Use the proper type family (M-STRONG-TYPES) { #M-STRONG-TYPES }

<why>the right data and safety invariants, at the right time.</why>

Use the appropriate `std` type for your task. In general you should use the strongest type available, as early as possible in your API flow. Common offenders are

| Do not use ... | use instead ... | Explanation                                        |
| -------------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `String`*      | `PathBuf`*      | Anything dealing with the OS should be `Path`-like |

That said, you should also follow common Rust `std` conventions. Purely numeric types at public API boundaries (e.g., `window_size()`) are expected to
be regular numbers, not `Saturating<usize>`, `NonZero<usize>`, or similar.

<sup>*</sup> Including their siblings, e.g., `&str`, `Path`, ...

</footnotes>

## Test utilities are feature gated (M-TEST-UTIL) { #M-TEST-UTIL }

<why>production builds that cannot bypass safety checks.</why>

Testing functionality must be guarded behind a feature flag. This includes

- mocking functionality ([M-MOCKABLE-SYSCALLS]),
- the ability to inspect sensitive data,
- safety check overrides,
- fake data generation.

We recommend you use a single flag only, named `test-util`. In any case, the feature(s) must clearly communicate they are for testing purposes.

```rust, ignore
impl HttpClient {
    pub fn get() { ... }

    #[cfg(feature = "test-util")]
    pub fn bypass_certificate_checks() { ... }
}
```

# Libraries / UX Guidelines

## Functions are `async` over returning a Future (M-ASYNC-FN) { #M-ASYNC-FN }

<why>simpler code and easier-to-understand APIs.</why>

Functions should be declared `async fn foo()` over `fn foo() -> impl Future` when both are viable.

Functions marked `async` are more idiomatic and easier to read. An explicit `Future`-returning signature should only be used when required, for example inside traits or for _hot 'n heavy_ async functions, compare [M-ASYNC-STACK-SIZE](../../performance/#M-ASYNC-STACK-SIZE).

```rust,ignore
impl Foo {
    // Bad, signature is noisier and the body needs an extra `async` block
    fn foo() -> impl Future<Output = Result<T, E>> { async { Ok(t) } }

    // Good, method and implementation reads normally
    async fn foo() -> Result<T, E> { Ok(t) }
}
```

## Avoid smart pointers and wrappers in APIs (M-AVOID-WRAPPERS) { #M-AVOID-WRAPPERS }

<why>low cognitive load and ergonomic APIs.</why>

As a specialization of [M-ABSTRACTIONS-DONT-NEST], generic wrappers and smart pointers like
`Rc<T>`, `Arc<T>`, `Box<T>`, or `RefCell<T>` should be avoided in public APIs.

From a user perspective these are mostly implementation details, and introduce infectious complexity that users have to
resolve. In fact, these might even be impossible to resolve once multiple crates disagree about the required type of wrapper.

If wrappers are needed internally, they should be hidden behind a clean API that uses simple types like `&T`, `&mut T`, or `T` directly. Compare:

```rust,ignore
// Good: simple API
pub fn process_data(data: &Data) -> State { ... }
pub fn store_config(config: Config) -> Result<(), Error> { ... }

// Bad: Exposing implementation details
pub fn process_shared(data: Arc<Mutex<Shared>>) -> Box<Processed> { ... }
pub fn initialize(config: Rc<RefCell<Config>>) -> Arc<Server> { ... }
```

Smart pointers in APIs are acceptable when:

- The smart pointer is fundamental to the API's purpose (e.g., a new container lib)

- The smart pointer, based on benchmarks, significantly improves performance and the complexity is justified.

[M-ABSTRACTIONS-DONT-NEST]: ./#M-ABSTRACTIONS-DONT-NEST

## Modules are balanced in size and scope (M-BALANCED-MODULES) { #M-BALANCED-MODULES }

<why>discoverable functionality and clear API usage.</why>

Your module design should approximately follow established UX practices of menu design: A _reasonable_ number of your most important items should be placed in the crate root, and a comprehensible grouping of the remaining functionality into subordinate modules.

Two violations of that rule are encountered most frequently: flat module roots containing dozens of items without clear ordering, or the excessive use of submodules without items in the crate root. While there are crates where this makes sense (e.g., automatically generated `-sys` crates defining 100s of C items, or umbrella crates like `std` and `tokio`), the majority of library crates are not among them.

When designing your module layout, consider these factors:

- Essential items users must find in order to use a crate should go into its root. For example, a `foo_client` crate should probably have its main `Client` struct inside the root.
- Other items should be grouped semantically by use case. Modules named `traits` and `errors` don't help anyone, but `account`, `network` and `status` do.
- Also take into account that modules are the perfect place for module-level documentation that further explains the respective subsystem.

## Collections implement the appropriate iter traits (M-COLLECTION-TRAITS) { #M-COLLECTION-TRAITS }

<why>composable collections.</why>

Custom collections should implement the iterator-facing traits the standard library offers.

Whenever you define a new collection type `Collection<T>` for consumption by third parties, the following traits and types should also be implemented, [see here](https://cheats.rs/#iterators) for more details:

- the structs `IntoIter<T>`, `Iter<T>` and `IterMut<T>`,
- an `impl Iterator` for all of them,
- the methods `c.iter()` and `c.iter_mut()`,
- an `impl IntoIterator` for `Collection<T>`, `&Collection<T>` and `&mut Collection<T>`,
- an `impl FromIterator` for `Collection<T>`,
- an `Extend` for `Collection<T>`,
- `DoubleEndedIterator`, `ExactSizeIterator`, ... as applicable

In addition, make sure you implement `size_hint()` on all iterators and do so truthfully.

## Prefer types over generics, generics over dyn traits (M-DI-HIERARCHY) { #M-DI-HIERARCHY }

<why>composable patterns and freedom from design lock-in.</why>

When asking for async dependencies, prefer concrete types over generics, and generics over `dyn Trait`.

It is easy to accidentally deviate from this pattern when porting code from languages like C# that heavily rely on interfaces.
Consider you are porting a service called `Database` from C# to Rust and, inspired by the original `IDatabase` interface, you naively translate it into:

```rust,ignore
trait Database {
    async fn update_config(&self, file: PathBuf);
    async fn store_object(&self, id: Id, obj: Object);
    async fn load_object(&self, id: Id) -> Object;
}

impl Database for MyDatabase { ... }

// Intended to be used like this:
async fn start_service(b: Rc<dyn Database>) { ... }
```

Apart from not feeling idiomatic, this approach precludes other Rust constructs that conflict with object safety,
can cause issues with asynchronous code, and exposes wrappers (compare [M-AVOID-WRAPPERS]).

Instead, when more than one implementation is needed, this _design escalation ladder_ should be followed:

If the other implementation is only concerned with providing a _sans-io_ implementation for testing, implement your type as an
enum, following [M-MOCKABLE-SYSCALLS] instead.

If users are expected to provide custom implementations, you should introduce one or more traits, and implement them for your own types
_on top_ of your inherent functions. Each trait should be relatively narrow, e.g., `StoreObject`, `LoadObject`. If eventually a single
trait is needed it should be made a subtrait, e.g., `trait DataAccess: StoreObject + LoadObject {}`.

Code working with these traits should ideally accept them as generic type parameters as long as their use does not contribute to significant nesting
(compare [M-ABSTRACTIONS-DONT-NEST]).

```rust,ignore
// Good, generic does not have infectious impact, uses only most specific trait
async fn read_database(x: impl LoadObject) { ... }

// Acceptable, unless further nesting makes this excessive.
struct MyService<T: DataAccess> {
    db: T,
}
```

Once generics become a nesting problem, `dyn Trait` can be considered. Even in this case, visible wrapping should be avoided, and custom wrappers should be preferred.

```rust
# use std::sync::Arc;
# trait DataAccess {
#     fn foo(&self);
# }
// This allows you to expand or change `DynamicDataAccess` later. You can also
// implement `DataAccess` for `DynamicDataAccess` if needed, and use it with
// regular generic functions.
struct DynamicDataAccess(Arc<dyn DataAccess>);

impl DynamicDataAccess {
    fn new<T: DataAccess + 'static>(db: T) -> Self {
        Self(Arc::new(db))
    }
}

struct MyService {
    db: DynamicDataAccess,
}
```

The generic wrapper can also be combined with the enum approach from [M-MOCKABLE-SYSCALLS]:

```rust,ignore
enum DataAccess {
    MyDatabase(MyDatabase),
    Mock(mock::MockCtrl),
    Dynamic(DynamicDataAccess)
}

async fn read_database(x: &DataAccess) { ... }
```

## Errors are canonical structs (M-ERRORS-CANONICAL-STRUCTS) { #M-ERRORS-CANONICAL-STRUCTS }

<why>harmonized error types and consistent error handling.</why>

Errors should be a situation-specific `struct` that contain a [`Backtrace`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/backtrace/struct.Backtrace.html),
a possible upstream error cause, and helper methods.

Simple crates usually expose a single error type `Error`, complex crates may expose multiple types, for example
`AccessError` and `ConfigurationError`. Error types should provide helper methods for additional information that allows callers to handle the error.

A simple error might look like so:

```rust
# use std::backtrace::Backtrace;
# use std::fmt::Display;
# use std::fmt::Formatter;
pub struct ConfigurationError {
    backtrace: Backtrace,
}

impl ConfigurationError {
    pub(crate) fn new() -> Self {
        Self { backtrace: Backtrace::capture() }
    }
}

// Impl Debug + Display
```

Where appropriate, error types should provide contextual error information, for example:

```rust,ignore
# use std::backtrace::Backtrace;
# #[derive(Debug)]
# pub struct ConfigurationError {
#    backtrace: Backtrace,
# }
impl ConfigurationError {
    pub fn config_file(&self) -> &Path { }
}
```

If your API does mixed operations, or depends on various upstream libraries, store an `ErrorKind`.
Error kinds, and more generally enum-based errors, should not be used to avoid creating separate public error types when there is otherwise no error overlap:

```rust, ignore
// Prefer this
fn download_iso() -> Result<(), DownloadError> {}
fn start_vm() -> Result<(), VmError> {}

// Over that
fn download_iso() -> Result<(), GlobalEverythingErrorEnum> {}
fn start_vm() -> Result<(), GlobalEverythingErrorEnum> {}

// However, not every function warrants a new error type. Errors
// should be general enough to be reused.
fn parse_json() -> Result<(), ParseError> {}
fn parse_toml() -> Result<(), ParseError> {}
```

If you do use an inner `ErrorKind`, that enum should not be exposed directly for future-proofing reasons,
as otherwise you would expose your callers to _all_ possible failure modes, even the ones you consider internal
and unhandleable. Instead, expose various `is_xxx()` methods as shown below:

```rust
# use std::backtrace::Backtrace;
# use std::fmt::Display;
# use std::fmt::Formatter;
#[derive(Debug)]
pub(crate) enum ErrorKind {
    Io(std::io::Error),
    Protocol
}

#[derive(Debug)]
pub struct HttpError {
    kind: ErrorKind,
    backtrace: Backtrace,
}

impl HttpError {
    pub fn is_io(&self) -> bool { matches!(self.kind, ErrorKind::Io(_)) }
    pub fn is_protocol(&self) -> bool { matches!(self.kind, ErrorKind::Protocol) }
}
```

Most upstream errors don't provide a backtrace. You should capture one when creating an `Error` instance, either via one of
your `Error::new()` flavors, or when implementing `From<UpstreamError> for Error {}`.

Error structs must properly implement `Display` that renders as follows:

```rust,ignore
impl Display for MyError {
    // Print a summary sentence what happened.
    // Print `self.backtrace`.
    // Print any additional upstream 'cause' information you might have.
#   fn fmt(&self, f: &mut Formatter<'_>) -> std::fmt::Result {
#       todo!()
#   }
}
```

Errors must also implement `std::error::Error`:

```rust,ignore
impl std::error::Error for MyError { }
```

Lastly, if you happen to emit lots of errors from your crate, consider creating a private `bail!()` helper macro to simplify error instantiation.

## Essential functionality should be inherent (M-ESSENTIAL-FN-INHERENT) { #M-ESSENTIAL-FN-INHERENT }

<why>easily discoverable essential functionality.</why>

Types should implement core functionality inherently. Trait implementations should forward to inherent functions, and not replace them. Instead of this

```rust
# trait Download {
#     fn download_file(&self, url: impl AsRef<str>);
# }
struct HttpClient {}

// Offloading essential functionality into traits means users
// will have to figure out what other traits to `use` to
// actually use this type.
impl Download for HttpClient {
    fn download_file(&self, url: impl AsRef<str>) {
        // ... logic to download a file
    }
}
```

do this:

```rust
# trait Download {
#     fn download_file(&self, url: impl AsRef<str>);
# }
struct HttpClient {}

impl HttpClient {
    fn download_file(&self, url: impl AsRef<str>) {
        // ... logic to download a file
    }
}

// Forward calls to inherent impls. `HttpClient` can be used
impl Download for HttpClient {
    fn download_file(&self, url: impl AsRef<str>) {
        Self::download_file(self, url)
    }
}
```

## Canonical error conversion uses `From`, not `map_err` (M-FROM-ERROR) { #M-FROM-ERROR }

<why>idiomatic error handling.</why>

Where an `Error` type is owned, it should `impl From<Other> for Error {}` instead of handling the conversion throughout the code via `.map_error()`. Calling `.map_error()` is only appropriate when dealing with foreign error types, or if contextual information needs to be preserved.

```rust,ignore
// Bad, repeats the same conversion at every call site and obscures the happy path.
fn load() -> Result<Config, MyError> {
    let bytes = read("config.toml").map_err(|e| MyError::Io(e))?;
    let text = str::from_utf8(&bytes).map_err(|e| MyError::Utf8(e))?;
    let cfg = toml::from_str(text).map_err(|e| MyError::Parse(e))?;
    Ok(cfg)
}

// Good, define the conversion once and let `?` apply it.
impl From<std::io::Error> for MyError { ... }
impl From<std::str::Utf8Error> for MyError { ... }
impl From<toml::de::Error> for MyError { ... }

fn load() -> Result<Config, MyError> {
    let bytes = read("config.toml")?;
    let text = str::from_utf8(&bytes)?;
    let cfg = toml::from_str(text)?;
    Ok(cfg)
}
```

## Complex type construction has builders (M-INIT-BUILDER) { #M-INIT-BUILDER }

<why>future-proof type construction in complex scenarios.</why>

Types that could support 4 or more arbitrary initialization permutations should provide builders. In other words, types with up to
2 optional initialization parameters can be constructed via inherent methods:

```rust
# struct A;
# struct B;
struct Foo;

// Supports 2 optional construction parameters, inherent methods ok.
impl Foo {
    pub fn new() -> Self { Self }
    pub fn with_a(a: A) -> Self { Self }
    pub fn with_b(b: B) -> Self { Self }
    pub fn with_a_b(a: A, b: B) -> Self { Self }
}
```

Beyond that, types should provide a builder:

```rust, ignore
# struct A;
# struct B;
# struct C;
# struct Foo;
# struct FooBuilder;
impl Foo {
    pub fn new() -> Self { ... }
    pub fn builder() -> FooBuilder { ... }
}

impl FooBuilder {
    pub fn a(mut self, a: A) -> Self { ... }
    pub fn b(mut self, b: B) -> Self { ... }
    pub fn c(mut self, c: C) -> Self { ... }
    pub fn build(self) -> Foo { ... }
}

```

The proper name for a builder that builds `Foo` is `FooBuilder`. Its methods must be chainable, with the final method called
`.build()`. The buildable struct must have a shortcut `Foo::builder()`, while the builder itself should _not_ have a public
`FooBuilder::new()`. Builder methods that set a value `x` are called `x()`, not `set_x()` or similar.

### Builders and Required Parameters

Required parameters should be passed when creating the builder, not as setter methods. For builders with multiple required
parameters, encapsulate them into a parameters struct and use the `deps: impl Into<Deps>` pattern to provide flexibility:

> **Note:** A dedicated deps struct is not required if the builder has no required parameters or only a single simple parameter. However,
> for backward compatibility and API evolution, it's preferable to use a dedicated struct for deps even in simple cases, as it makes it
> easier to add new required parameters in the future without breaking existing code.

```rust, ignore
#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
pub struct FooDeps {
    pub logger: Logger,
    pub config: Config,
}

impl From<(Logger, Config)> for FooDeps { ... }
impl From<Logger> for FooDeps { ... } // In case we could use default Config instance

impl Foo {
    pub fn builder(deps: impl Into<FooDeps>) -> FooBuilder { ... }
}
```

This pattern allows for convenient usage:

- `Foo::builder(logger)` - when only the logger is needed
- `Foo::builder((logger, config))` - when both parameters are needed
- `Foo::builder(FooDeps { logger, config })` - explicit struct construction

Alternatively, you can use [`fundle`](https://docs.rs/fundle) to simplify the creation of `FooDeps`:

```rust, ignore
#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
#[fundle::deps]
pub struct FooDeps {
    pub logger: Logger,
    pub config: Config,
}
```

This pattern enables "dependency injection", see [these docs](https://docs.rs/fundle/latest/fundle/attr.deps.html) for more details.

### Runtime-Specific Builders

For types that are runtime-specific or require runtime-specific configuration, provide dedicated builder creation methods that accept the appropriate runtime parameters:

```rust, ignore
#[cfg(feature="smol")]
#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
pub struct SmolDeps {
    pub clock: Clock,
    pub io_context: Context,
}

#[cfg(feature="tokio")]
#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
pub struct TokioDeps {
    pub clock: Clock,
}

impl Foo {
    #[cfg(feature="smol")]
    pub fn builder_smol(deps: impl Into<SmolDeps>) -> FooBuilder { ... }

    #[cfg(feature="tokio")]
    pub fn builder_tokio(deps: impl Into<TokioDeps>) -> FooBuilder { ... }
}
```

This approach ensures type safety at compile time and makes the runtime dependency explicit in the API surface. The resulting
builder methods follow the pattern `builder_{runtime}(deps)` where `{runtime}` indicates the specific runtime or execution environment.

## Complex type initialization hierarchies are cascaded (M-INIT-CASCADED) { #M-INIT-CASCADED }

<why>construction free of parameter mix-ups.</why>

Types that require 4+ parameters should cascade their initialization via helper types.

```rust, ignore
# struct Deposit;
impl Deposit {
    // Easy to confuse parameters and signature generally unwieldy.
    pub fn new(bank_name: &str, customer_name: &str, currency_name: &str, currency_amount: u64) -> Self { }
}
```

Instead of providing a long parameter list, parameters should be grouped semantically. When applying this guideline,
also check if [C-NEWTYPE] is applicable:

```rust, ignore
# struct Deposit;
# struct Account;
# struct Currency
impl Deposit {
    // Better, signature cleaner
    pub fn new(account: Account, amount: Currency) -> Self { }
}

impl Account {
    pub fn new_ok(bank: &str, customer: &str) -> Self { }
    pub fn new_even_better(bank: Bank, customer: Customer) -> Self { }
}
```

## Don't define preludes (M-NO-PRELUDE) { #M-NO-PRELUDE }

<why>a clean namespace and reliable downstream builds.</why>

Crates must not define a `prelude` or any namespace intended to be imported as `use foo::*`.

While the Rust Standard Library successfully uses [preludes](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/prelude/index.html) to define edition items, preludes in crates cause more harm than good. Given today's IDE support they are not needed, and once multiple preludes are used from different crates there is potential for conflicts:

```rust,ignore
use foo::prelude::*;
use bar::prelude::*;
use baz::prelude::*;

_ = Client::new();

// error[E0659]: `Client` is ambiguous
//   --> src/lib.rs:17:13
//    |
// 17 |     _ = Client;
//    |         ^^^^^^ ambiguous name
//    |
//    = note: ambiguous because of multiple glob imports of a name in the same module
```

Preludes in particular do not resolve bad module design. If it looks like a prelude would make the crate easier to use or understand, this is almost always an indication that the existing module system needs restructuring, see [M-BALANCED-MODULES](./#M-BALANCED-MODULES).

## Parameter ordering is consistent (M-PARAMETER-CONSISTENCY) { #M-PARAMETER-CONSISTENCY }

<why>low development friction.</why>

When the same conceptual parameters appear in multiple functions (within a crate or across crates in the same ecosystem), they should appear in the same order everywhere:

- important or call-specific parameters should generally go first,
- ubiquitous parameters rather go last (e.g., `&logger`),
- closures always go last (functions should not accept more than one closure).

```rust,ignore
// Bad, the order of `user_id` and `tenant_id` flips between functions, and
// the logger sometimes appears first, sometimes last.
fn create_user(logger: &Logger, user_id: UserId, tenant_id: TenantId) -> Result<()> { ... }
fn delete_user(tenant_id: TenantId, user_id: UserId, logger: &Logger) -> Result<()> { ... }
fn rename_user(user_id: UserId, new_name: &str, tenant_id: TenantId, logger: &Logger) -> Result<()> { ... }

// Good, call-specific parameters first in a consistent order, ubiquitous
// `logger` always last.
fn create_user(tenant_id: TenantId, user_id: UserId, logger: &Logger) -> Result<()> { ... }
fn delete_user(tenant_id: TenantId, user_id: UserId, logger: &Logger) -> Result<()> { ... }
fn rename_user(tenant_id: TenantId, user_id: UserId, new_name: &str, logger: &Logger) -> Result<()> { ... }
```

## Services are Clone (M-SERVICES-CLONE) { #M-SERVICES-CLONE }

<why>composable sharing of common services.</why>

Heavyweight _service_ types and 'thread singletons' should implement shared-ownership `Clone` semantics, including any type you expect to be used from your `Application::init`.

Per thread, users should essentially be able to create a single resource handler instance, and have it reused by other handlers on the same thread:

```rust,ignore
impl ThreadLocal for MyThreadState {
    fn init(...) -> Self {

        // Create common service instance possibly used by many.
        let common = ServiceCommon::new();

        // Users can freely pass `common` here multiple times
        let service_1 = ServiceA::new(&common);
        let service_2 = ServiceA::new(&common);

        Self { ... }
    }
}
```

Services then simply clone their dependency and store a new _handle_, as if `ServiceCommon` were a shared-ownership smart pointer:

```rust,ignore
impl ServiceA {
    pub fn new(common: &ServiceCommon) -> Self {
        // If we only need to access `common` from `new` we don't have
        // to store it. Otherwise, make a clone we store in `Self`.
        let common = common.clone();
    }
}
```

Under the hood this `Clone` should **not** create a fat copy of the entire service. Instead, it should follow the `Arc<Inner>` pattern:

```rust, ignore
// Actual service containing core logic and data.
struct ServiceCommonInner {}

#[derive(Clone)]
pub ServiceCommon {
    inner: Arc<ServiceCommonInner>
}

impl ServiceCommon {
    pub fn new() {
        Self { inner: Arc::new(ServiceCommonInner::new()) }
    }

    // Method forwards ...
    pub fn foo(&self) { self.inner.foo() }
    pub fn bar(&self) { self.inner.bar() }
}
```

## Abstractions don't visibly nest (M-SIMPLE-ABSTRACTIONS) { #M-SIMPLE-ABSTRACTIONS }

<why>low cognitive load and a good out-of-the-box UX.</why>

When designing your public types and primary API surface, avoid exposing nested or complex parametrized types to your users.

While powerful, type parameters introduce a cognitive load, even more so if the involved traits are crate-specific. Type parameters
become infectious to user code holding on to these types in their fields, often come with complex trait hierarchies on their own, and
might cause confusing error messages.

From the perspective of a user authoring `Foo`, where the other structs come from your crate:

```rust,ignore
struct Foo {
    service: Service // Great
    service: Service<Backend> // Acceptable
    service: Service<Backend<Store>> // Bad

    list: List<Rc<u32>> // Great, `List<T>` is simple container,
                        // other types user provided.

    matrix: Matrix4x4 // Great
    matrix: Matrix4x4<f32> // Still ok
    matrix: Matrix<f32, Const<4>, Const<4>, ArrayStorage<f32, 4, 4>> // ?!?
}
```

_Visible_ type parameters should be avoided in _service-like_ types (i.e., types mainly instantiated once per thread / application that are often passed
as dependencies), in particular if the nestee originates from the same crate as the service.

Containers, smart-pointers and similar data structures obviously must expose a type parameter, e.g., `List<T>` above. Even then, care should
be taken to limit the number and nesting of parameters.

To decide whether type parameter nesting should be avoided, consider these factors:

- Will the type be **named** by your users?
  - Service-level types are always expected to be named (e.g., `Library<T>`),
  - Utility types, such as the many [`std::iter`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/iter/index.html) types like `Chain`, `Cloned`, `Cycle`, are not
    expected to be named.
- Does the type primarily compose with non-user types?
- Do the used type parameters have complex bounds?
- Do the used type parameters affect inference in other types or functions?

The more of these factors apply, the bigger the cognitive burden.

As a rule of thumb, primary service API types should not nest _on their own volition_, and if they do, only 1 level deep. In other words, these
APIs should not require users having to deal with an `Foo<Bar<FooBar>>`. However, if `Foo<T>` users want to bring their own `A<B<C>>` as `T` they
should be free to do so.

- **Dead code handling**: Never use file-wide `#![allow(dead_code)]` directives at the root of a file. Don't use `allow(dead_code)` unless you absolutely "have to"; always prefer `expect(dead_code)` so that the compiler forces you to remove the attribute once the code actually becomes used. If unused variants, functions, or scaffolding exist intentionally during development or API specification, specifically target those lines or blocks using `#[expect(dead_code)]`.
